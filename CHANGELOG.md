# Changelog

All notable public-facing changes to Base2026 are summarized here.

## 2026-06-19 — Source Intelligence contract release

Live release: `base2026-source-intelligence-contract-ay54-20260619`

## Older work

Before the public launch foundation, Base2026 was developed as a local research and source-intelligence prototype. Older private research artifacts, raw captions, raw ASR, local databases, media files, and generated release archives are intentionally excluded from the public changelog and repository.
