# Base2026 Agent Operating Contract

## Rule 0: repo files are source of truth

Codex, Hermes, and any other agent must start from checked-in project files, not from chat memory.

Before any meaningful work, read:

- `docs/project-memory/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/project-memory/ACTIVE_PHASE.md`
- `docs/project-memory/NEXT_ACTION.md`
- `docs/project-memory/DECISIONS.md`
- `docs/project-memory/DATA_SOURCES.md`
- `docs/project-memory/STATUS_BOARD.csv`
- `docs/project-memory/PHASES.md`
- `docs/project-memory/PUBLICATION_BOUNDARY.md`

For deployment or automation tasks, also read:

- `docs/project-memory/DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md`
- `docs/project-memory/HERMES_RUNBOOK.md`

For public UI tasks, also read:

- `docs/project-memory/VISUAL_SYSTEM_CONTRACT.md`

## Public/private boundary

Never commit or publish private research, raw source vaults, credentials, logs, generated release archives, local database files, audio/video files, or unreviewed raw captions.

Use `docs/GIT_PUBLICATION_AUDIT.md` and `docs/project-memory/PUBLICATION_BOUNDARY.md` before staging.

## Work protocol

One phase or tightly scoped task per session.

At task start:

- check `git status`
- confirm current active phase from `ACTIVE_PHASE.md`
- confirm forbidden actions
- identify expected output files

At task end:

- update `NEXT_ACTION.md`
- update `PROMPT_LOG.md`
- update `STATUS_BOARD.csv` when phase state changes
- update `DATA_SOURCES.md` when source status changes
- update `DECISIONS.md` only for real durable decisions
- report changed files and suggested commit message

Do not commit, push, deploy, or run intake automation unless the user asked for it in the current task.

## Reviewer role

Every implementation pass must include a reviewer pass:

- check whether task output matches the request
- check public/private leakage risk
- check whether docs point to correct files
- check whether next action is concrete
- if a mismatch exists, fix root cause before reporting done
