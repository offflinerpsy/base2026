# Reddit Search + Base2026 Creator Expansion Research — 2026-06-23

Status: research brief, not yet an intake/import run.  
Prepared for: Base2026 / Agency OS Research.  
Timestamp: 2026-06-23 02:53 Minsk time.

## Executive verdict

1. **Reddit comments are usable without API keys, but not through Reddit itself as the primary path.** Current direct `reddit.com/*.json` tests returned 403 from this machine. The practical no-key path is **PullPush for comment search** + **Arctic Shift for full/deep thread trees**.
2. **For Base2026 expansion, prioritize video-first marketing/GEO/AEO/local SEO creators first**, then add AI marketing agent/skill repositories as a new source category, then WebDevLog/AI web-development workflow sources.
3. **Do not immediately publish/import all new candidates.** Add them as staged pipeline candidates first, run discovery/check-only, then send only clean TikTok/video records through the existing Base2026 review/release gates.
4. **Recommended next execution slice:** add a small P1 batch of 8–10 marketing creators and 6–8 OSS/WebDevLog sources to a private intake queue, dry-run discovery/import, then review results before any public release.

## 1. Reddit comments: free/no-key research stack

### Recommended stack

- **Primary comment search:** PullPush
  - URL: https://pullpush.io/
  - Best for: keyword search across Reddit comments, filtering by subreddit/time/author/link.
- **Primary deep thread/tree extraction:** Arctic Shift
  - API docs/source: https://github.com/ArthurHeitmann/arctic_shift/tree/master/api
  - Base: https://arctic-shift.photon-reddit.com
  - Best for: full comment tree by `link_id`, deep branches, comment-rich threads.
- **Fallback only:** Reddit `.json`
  - Direct checks from current machine returned 403.
  - Even when accessible, depth is limited and `morechildren` expansion usually needs auth/OAuth.

### PullPush examples

Search comments by phrase:

```bash
curl "https://api.pullpush.io/reddit/search/comment/?q=chatgpt&subreddit=LocalLLaMA&size=100&sort=desc&sort_type=created_utc"
```

Search comments inside a specific thread:

```bash
curl "https://api.pullpush.io/reddit/search/comment/?link_id=6uey5x&size=100"
```

Search by date window:

```bash
curl "https://api.pullpush.io/reddit/search/comment/?q=%22battery%20life%22&subreddit=iphone&after=1704067200&before=1735689600&size=100"
```

Limits/risks:

- `size` is limited, paginate with `before/after`.
- Archive can lag fresh Reddit.
- Old Pushshift-derived archives may contain deleted/removed content; treat as privacy-sensitive.

### Arctic Shift examples

Search comments:

```bash
curl "https://arctic-shift.photon-reddit.com/api/comments/search?subreddit=LocalLLaMA&body=chatgpt&limit=100&fields=id,author,body,score,created_utc,link_id,parent_id"
```

Fetch all comments for a post:

```bash
curl "https://arctic-shift.photon-reddit.com/api/comments/search?link_id=t3_POSTID&limit=auto&fields=id,author,body,score,created_utc,parent_id"
```

Fetch deep comment tree:

```bash
curl "https://arctic-shift.photon-reddit.com/api/comments/tree?link_id=t3_POSTID&limit=25000&start_depth=50&start_breadth=999" -o reddit_thread_POSTID.json
```

Live check from worker:

- `comments/search?link_id=...` returned 200.
- `comments/tree?link_id=...&limit=9999&start_depth=50&start_breadth=999` returned 200 and ~3.3 MB JSON.

Limits/risks:

- No uptime/performance guarantees.
- Broad full-text searches can timeout; narrow by subreddit/date.
- Data can differ from live Reddit for fresh content.

### OSS/MCP candidates

- `pullpush-mcp`: https://github.com/jacklenzotti/pullpush-mcp
  - MCP wrapper for PullPush.
  - Candidate for Hermes MCP integration after quick audit.
- `reddit-comment-harvester`: https://github.com/wlyastn/reddit-comment-harvester
  - Uses public Reddit `.json`; weaker now because direct `.json` can 403.
- `hkay-dev/reddit-scraper`: https://github.com/hkay-dev/reddit-scraper
  - Also depends on visible public JSON; does not reliably expand `load more comments`.

### Compliance guardrails

- Use public content only.
- No login/cookie scraping for Reddit by default.
- No CAPTCHA bypass, residential proxies, or private subreddit scraping.
- Cache and throttle.
- Minimize usernames/PII in durable storage.
- For commercial or large-scale Reddit data usage, require legal/API review.

### Proposed Base2026/Hermes Reddit workflow

1. Use PullPush to discover candidate discussions.
2. Use Arctic Shift to fetch full thread trees for selected `link_id`s.
3. Flatten tree locally: `id`, `parent_id`, `depth`, `body`, `score`, `created_utc`, `author`, `link_id`.
4. Rank branches by depth, score, and keyword relevance.
5. Send only selected branches to LLM; do not dump entire comment trees into context.
6. Store source URLs and retrieval timestamp; keep raw comment dumps private unless explicitly cleared.

## 2. Base2026 marketer/GEO/AEO creator expansion

### P1: add to pipeline first

These should be the first human/creator targets for discovery/intake review because they are strongly relevant and have public video/interview/tutorial footprints.

### Intake recommendation

Do not bulk-add all 25 at once. First run:

- P1 batch: Aleyda, Lily, Michael King, Rand/SparkToro, Christopher Penn, Ethan Smith, Joy Hawkins, Sarvesh, Caleb.
- Keep Darren Shaw as already-indexed anchor; use refresh only if needed.
- For each candidate, identify concrete public video/social source before adding to Base2026 private intake config.
- If no TikTok feed exists, route to `youtube/blog/interview candidate` backlog instead of forcing into TikTok pipeline.

## 5. Backlog: next concrete tasks

### B26-RESEARCH-01 — Reddit comment research adapter

Goal: make a safe no-key Reddit comment research lane for Hermes/Base2026.

Acceptance criteria:

- Small local script or skill wrapper for PullPush comment search.
- Small local script or skill wrapper for Arctic Shift comment tree fetch.
- Output format: JSONL with `thread_url`, `comment_id`, `parent_id`, `depth`, `score`, `created_utc`, `body`, `retrieved_at`, `source_api`.
- PII minimization option: hash or omit usernames by default.
- Rate limiting and cache folder.
- Document compliance guardrails.

### B26-PIPELINE-01 — staged P1 marketer creator expansion

Goal: add 8–10 P1 marketers as staged candidates, not public output.

Candidate set:

- Aleyda Solis
- Lily Ray
- Michael King/iPullRank
- Rand Fishkin/SparkToro
- Christopher Penn/Trust Insights
- Ethan Smith/Graphite
- Joy Hawkins/Sterling Sky
- Sarvesh Shrivastava
- Caleb Ulku
- Darren Shaw refresh only if needed

Acceptance criteria:

- Candidate source URLs verified.
- Platform type recorded: TikTok / YouTube / blog / newsletter / interview.
- Only candidates with compatible discoverable video feeds go into private intake config.
- Dry-run discovery/import before any apply.
- No public release until reviewed source text + Source Intelligence gates pass.

### B26-TAXONOMY-01 — add AI Marketing Agents & Skills category

Goal: create a category model and seed source list for agentic marketing skills/repos.

Seed repos:

- coreyhaines31/marketingskills
- ericosiu/ai-marketing-skills
- zubair-trabzada/ai-marketing-claude
- aitytech/agentkits-marketing
- indranilbanerjee/digital-marketing-pro
- BrianRWagner/ai-marketing-claude-code-skills
- thatrebeccarae/claude-marketing
- thearnavrustagi/marketmenow

Acceptance criteria:

- Repo metadata fields defined: stars/forks, pushed_at, license, compatibility, artifact types, maturity, risk notes.
- Star-history/anomaly caveat included.
- Category does not mix with human video creators; it is a separate source type.

### B26-TAXONOMY-02 — add WebDevLog / AI web-dev workflows category

Goal: track practical AI web-development workflows, not generic AI tool listicles.

Seed sources:

- Addy Osmani LLM coding workflow
- Matt Lambert Claude Code projects
- Samanvya Tripathi feature workflow
- Mikul Gohil Claude Code workflows
- Shawn Lin Agent Plugins
- Zen van Riel agentic engineer workflow
- AI with Avthar Claude Code setup
- Upstash Context7
- wshobson/agents
- obra/superpowers

Acceptance criteria:

- Fields for tools mentioned, commands/files, MCPs, GitHub workflow, worktrees, verification loops.
- Separate blog/video/source-code source types.
- Prioritize sources with concrete commands/workflows over generic opinion.

## 6. Do-not-do list

- Do not scrape Reddit through login/cookies/proxies as default.
- Do not store raw Reddit dumps or usernames in public repo.
- Do not bulk-import all creator candidates into public Base2026.
- Do not bypass existing Base2026 source-review/readiness/publication gates.
- Do not trust GitHub star counts alone; verify repo quality/activity before ranking.

## 7. Recommended immediate next step

Create a private staged candidate file for the P1 marketer batch and OSS/WebDevLog seed sources, then run only metadata/discovery dry-runs. After that, select the cleanest 3–5 sources for a first actual Base2026 intake/release pass.
