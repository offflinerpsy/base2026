# Staged Base2026 Source Candidates — 2026-06-23

Status: local/private staging queue; not a public Base2026 release artifact.
Source: Alex voice approval in Telegram + `REDDIT_AND_BASE2026_CREATOR_EXPANSION_RESEARCH_2026_06_23.md`.

## Owner decision captured

- Prior Reddit/creator expansion research brief is accepted as directionally correct.
- Implement Reddit comments lane as PullPush search + Arctic Shift deep thread/tree fetch.
- Add new source categories locally first; do not bulk-publish.
- For TikTok/short-form sources, prioritize videos that can be turned into coherent text transcripts: spoken explanations, captions/subtitles, interviews, walkthroughs.
- Reject/hold visual-only TikToks where the value is mostly screen text, gestures, UI montage, or music with little/no spoken content.

## Transcript suitability gate for TikTok/video candidates

A candidate can enter the private intake queue only if at least one source video passes:

- `spoken_density`: high enough that speech/audio carries the main idea.
- `caption_availability`: platform captions, extracted transcript, or reliable audio transcription path exists.
- `context_completeness`: transcript alone explains the concept without needing every visual frame.
- `technical_specificity`: includes concrete workflows, tools, commands, prompts, stack, or repeatable process.
- `public_safety`: public source; no login/cookie scraping/CAPTCHA bypass; no private/raw dumps published.

Suggested statuses:

- `candidate` — found but not checked.
- `transcript_check` — needs transcript extraction/manual check.
- `queue_private_intake` — good spoken-text candidate; can enter private intake/dry-run.
- `hold_visual_only` — useful visually, but bad for text knowledge base.
- `reject_low_signal` — generic/opinion/listicle with little reusable substance.

## Next execution queue

2. For TikTok candidates, check whether TikTok exposes useful captions/transcripts or whether audio transcription is needed.
3. Move only text-rich candidates into private intake/dry-run.
4. Keep OSS repo categories separate from creator/video categories.
5. Do not publish to public Base2026 until existing source review and release gates pass.
