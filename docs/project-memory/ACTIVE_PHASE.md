# Active Phase

Last updated: 2026-06-19

## Current active phase

Public product architecture correction plus launch monitoring and check-only TikTok intake pipeline hardening.

## Why this is active

The public intelligence layer is deployed, GitHub publication is complete, WordPress lead-flow is live, and the current source-with-passages/no-card backfill queue is closed. The immediate priority is to correct the public product contract so the UI behaves like the intended searchable video-source database, while continuing launch/indexing/analytics monitoring and local-first TikTok/source pipeline work through reviewed gates.

## Current exact task

Operate the Base2026/geo launch command center through scoped workers: validate deployed Ahrefs/GSC launch fixes with local crawl gates, mine the public Base2026 dataset for practical SEO/content/growth work, and run TikTok/source refreshes only through the canonical release gate. The current live Base2026 data/UI release is `base2026-source-review-local-caption-ay50-20260619`. The local social-discovery bridge is implemented and proven through live releases: `scripts/social-discover.py` writes ignored private JSONL, `scripts/import-social-discovery-to-tiktok-csv.py` dry-runs/applies TikTok-only rows into ignored private `videos.csv` with backup and dedupe, and `scripts/base2026-release-gate.ps1 -LatestReadiness 3` owns public export, deploy, reindex, and live QA for fresh source batches. `scripts/hermes-tiktok-refresh.ps1 -AfterPolish` now skips inventory/caption intake and only rebuilds from existing reviewed polish outputs, preventing accidental queue expansion during release packaging.

The current live export has 1464 source records, 1998 passages, 1630 insight cards, 1059 public insight cards, 1521 topics, 1007 public topics, and 10 creators. Current live release is `base2026-source-review-local-caption-ay50-20260619`. The AI Recommends Solutions creator pass is closed live: 100 TikTok candidate rows were imported from ignored private discovery output, 77 polished transcripts were reviewed, 46 public-ready sources are represented after ASR recovery, readiness cards, and twelve explicit local-caption source-review cleanups, and the remaining uncertain rows stayed private/gated. ay43 briefly showed why single-source readiness was too narrow; ay44 added two exact-evidence `@gobigsystems` Source Intelligence cards, ay45 kept weak/no-speech ASR rows private, ay46 confirmed `-LatestReadiness 3` must remain active for every fresh source batch, and ay47-ay50 proved the guarded `tiktok-clear-reviewed-source-rows.py` transition for explicit QA-pass source-review rows.

Future creators and fresh TikTok refreshes must enter through ignored local config, private discovery JSONL, importer dry-run/apply, current-batch polish gate, newest-source readiness, and then the canonical release gate. The source-detail contract keeps reviewed `public_source_text`, `source_summary_short`, and `source_summary_long`, keeps legacy `transcript` empty, collapses reviewed evidence inside Source Intelligence cards by default, suppresses duplicate/fragmentary source-evidence disclosures that are already present in Source Text, preserves readable paragraph breaks and chunks long ASR/TikTok source text, suppresses duplicate lead/summary copy in source detail, keeps compact runtime source share/meta controls, adds Source Intelligence share/copy/print controls, blocks newest source-only records with no topics/public insights during release packaging, keeps public info pages/roadmap/support aligned with the corrected product passport, exposes `/knowledge/api.html` plus public AI/API entry points, emits shared OG/X social metadata for indexable generated/info/search entry pages, keeps exactly one visible H1 in hydrated source-detail views, keeps search-result identity links and TikTok outbound source links, keeps shared Alex Yarosh favicon/touch-icon assets, and keeps the footer `Socials` row with working X/GitHub links plus a disabled TikTok placeholder. Clean rebuild now replays ignored reviewed legacy/candidate insight archives. Current transcript status is 1464 transcribed public-source records with source-review debt gated. Remaining QA debt is the historical audio/source-verification transcript rows plus source-access review debt that must stay gated.

## Important note

Generated public pages should not be committed by default; prefer reproducible generation from scripts. Public deploys are allowed only after export policy, publication boundary, and live QA pass.
