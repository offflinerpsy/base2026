# Prompt Log

## 2026-06-23 — Ahrefs/GSC live SEO check after ay55

User asked to continue down the SEO list and try the open Ahrefs / Google Search Console tabs.

Actions:

- Opened Ahrefs Dashboard for project `9961307` / `Aggressorbulkit`; captured visible metrics and crawl state.
- Opened GSC domain property `aggressorbulkit.online`; captured Performance and Page indexing overview signals.
- Ran live terminal SEO smoke for robots, sitemap, representative pages, sitemap canonical/indexability sample, bot user agents, OG/X metadata, and HTTP→HTTPS handling.
- Updated `AHREFS_SITE_AUDIT_BACKLOG_2026_06_17.md` and task CSV statuses for social metadata / sitemap smoke status.

Evidence:

- Ahrefs dashboard: Health Score `Crawl failed`; DR `0`; referring domains `76` (`+41`); organic traffic/keywords `0`.
- GSC Performance: last 3 months `0` clicks, `110` impressions, average position `27.8`.
- GSC Pages: `29` indexed, `814` not indexed, `6` reasons.
- Live `/knowledge/sitemap.xml`: `1,577` URLs across 4 sitemap files; no `index.html?` sitemap URLs; sampled 70 URLs had no non-200, no canonical mismatch, no noindex.
- Representative live pages self-canonical and `index,follow`; bot user agents return 200.

Next:

- Restart/fix Ahrefs Site Audit crawl for project `9961307` and export fresh CSVs.
- Prioritize source-page discoverability / crawlable archive and query-state duplicate cleanup because GSC has only 29 indexed pages against 1,577 sitemap URLs.

## 2026-06-23 — ay55 creator avatar asset hotfix

User approved proceeding with the Base2026 plan: close dirty repo state, run safety checks, then do a live SEO/UI smoke pass.

Actions:

- classified the dirty research/staging docs as public-safe candidates;
- ran boundary/export/release/readiness checks;
- found live `/knowledge/` console 404s for missing creator avatar assets (`harrysandersseo`, `gobigsystems`, `iamdandavies`);
- repaired local Homebrew Node after it was linked against a missing `libsimdjson.29.dylib`;
- fetched stable TikTok creator avatar assets into `web/static/assets/creators/`;
- regenerated public TikTok export so avatar URLs propagate through creators/source/documents/passages/chunks;
- patched `scripts/package-public-hotfix-from-export.ps1` so optional static analytics/signal files fall back to `web/static`;
- packaged, deployed, and reindexed `base2026-creator-avatar-assets-ay55-20260623`.

Verification:

- `python3 scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py` => `needs_review=0`, `forbidden=0`, `secret_findings=0`;
- public export policy, release contract, and newest-source readiness passed;
- VPS deploy verified nginx active and current symlink at `base2026-creator-avatar-assets-ay55-20260623`;
- Meilisearch reindexed 2,016 passages, task `407`;
- live avatar assets return 200 image/jpeg;
- live Meili proxy returns `@gobigsystems` with `/knowledge/static/assets/creators/gobigsystems.jpeg`;
- desktop/tablet Base2026 visual QA passed 14/14, failures 0: `output/evidence/mobile-visual-qa-20260623-152404-base-smoke-after-avatar/report.md`.

Not done:

- no Git commit/push yet; working tree now contains the research/staging docs plus ay55 avatar/package/public-export changes.

## 2026-06-22 — GitHub open-source readiness docs cleanup

User asked to stop only reporting gaps and directly fix the GitHub/project docs for Base2026 before funding/open-source submissions.

Actions:

- updated `README.md` from stale ay39 metrics to live ay54 metrics and added links to project docs;
- added human-readable `GOVERNANCE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`;
- added `.github/FUNDING.yml` with safe commented placeholders until public sponsor accounts are configured;
- updated `scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py` and `docs/project-memory/PUBLICATION_BOUNDARY.md` so these new public docs are recognized as public-safe.

Verification:

- `git diff --check` passed;
- `python3 scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py` passed with `changed_files=19`, `public_safe_candidates=19`, `needs_review=0`, `forbidden=0`, `secret_findings=0`;
- `python3 scripts/validate-github-metadata.py` passed;
- `.github/FUNDING.yml` parses as YAML.

Not done:

- no commit, push, deploy, or release-gate run in this pass.

## 2026-06-19 — ay46 readiness-card release and anti-loop sync

User paused the long run to verify Codex was not looping after a context compaction. Codex checked live symlink/state instead of repeating the whole project-memory bundle.

Result:

- live symlink points to `base2026-gobig-readiness-card-ay46-20260619`;
- ay46 adds one strict exact-evidence `@gobigsystems` Source Intelligence card for `Google Business Profile Categories`;
- public export is now 1452 source records, 1980 passages, 1630 insight cards, 1059 public insight cards, 1521 topics, 1007 public topics, and 10 creators;
- newest-source readiness, public export policy, and public release contract pass;
- memory/runbook state was synced from ay45 to ay46 so the next resume does not redo the old release step.

## 2026-06-19 — ay44 readiness fix, about hero finalization, and launch-memory cleanup

User asked why the guide/memory keeps accumulating stale state, requested a clear video-processing status, and pointed out that the `/about/` founder hero still looked oversized from the visible screenshot.

Actions:

- deployed the focused WordPress `/about/` hero geometry fix as theme `style.css` version `1.5.55`, verified live desktop/MacBook/mobile metrics, and pushed the `geo` repo commit `e349ce4`;
- mechanically cleaned and approved 3 AI Recommends transcript rows through the review-apply gate, increasing the public-ready slice from 30 to 33;
- fixed two fresh `@gobigsystems` source-only readiness blockers with exact-evidence reviewed Source Intelligence cards;
- deployed `base2026-ai-recommends-readiness-fix-ay44-20260619` through the canonical release gate with `-LatestReadiness 3`, Meilisearch reindex, live SEO crawl, and mobile visual QA;
- synced launch memory so the handoff/next-action/runbook no longer points at ay42 as current live state.

Result:

- live Base2026 export is 1450 source records, 1978 passages, 1629 insight cards, 1058 public insight cards, 1521 topics, 1006 public topics, 10 creators;
- live release is `base2026-ai-recommends-readiness-fix-ay44-20260619`;
- current private source-review debt is 61 rows and remains gated.

## 2026-06-19 — GitHub branch push and handoff sync

User asked to keep closing the active launch goal until Git, deploy, and production state are not ambiguous.

Actions:

- confirmed `codex/base2026-launch-next` is clean and pushed to GitHub at `b10d9e5e5`;
- confirmed the WordPress/geo branch `codex/novamira-plugin-evaluation` is clean and pushed to GitHub at `e1a2510`;
- corrected launch memory that still claimed commit/push had not happened;
- verified both branches are fast-forwardable over their `origin/main` branches before considering main-branch shipping.
- fast-forwarded Base2026 GitHub `main` from `codex/base2026-launch-next` without force-pushing.

Next:

- future source/data releases must continue through `scripts/base2026-release-gate.ps1` before deploy/reindex/live QA.

## 2026-06-18 — About hero geometry hotfix and TikTok review queue recount

User reported that the `/about/` first hero still rendered as an oversized poster on a laptop viewport and asked for a clear status on Hermes/TikTok processing.

Actions:

- deployed a focused WordPress CSS geometry hotfix in `geo/wp-theme/alex-yarosh/style.css` version `1.5.53`;
- bounded the about hero height and portrait figure height so the portrait can no longer drive the hero to poster scale;
- verified live `/about/` at 1440x900, 1280x800, and 390x844 with Playwright screenshots and metrics;
- reran the TikTok source-review audit and updated current gated queue counts.

Result:

- live `/about/` loads the child theme stylesheet with a file-timestamp cache-bust, currently `style.css?ver=1781829722`;
- live hero measurements: 1440x900 `1120x405`, 1280x800 `1120x371`, 390x844 `366x404`;
- current TikTok source-review backlog is 64 private rows: 48 local-caption review rows, 14 audio-backed ASR-retry rows, and 2 rows without usable local caption/audio.

## 2026-06-18 — Public TikTok transcript polish audio-retry batch 001

User asked to process `hermes-polish-20260618-audio-retry/batch-001.md` using the GPT-5.5 quality lane and create/update one polished transcript plus one QA JSON per video.

Actions taken:

- checked worktree state and confirmed active Phase 2 transcript-polish/publication rules;
- read only the required project-memory files, the named batch file, and the exact output files created for this task;
- processed 1 TikTok video from `batch-001.md`;
- wrote 1 polished transcript file under `12_knowledge-base/sources/tiktok/transcripts/polished/`;
- wrote 1 QA JSON file under `12_knowledge-base/sources/tiktok/transcripts/polished-qa/`;
- preserved the repeated raw `Lizard!` caption text and marked the row `needs_review` because it appears to be a caption/audio artifact requiring source/audio verification.

Verification:

- validated the QA JSON parses as JSON;
- validated `model_tier` is `gpt-5.5`;
- validated `meaning_added=false`;
- validated polished word count and paragraph count against the written `.txt` file;
- final QA totals: 0 `pass`, 1 `needs_review`, 0 `failed`.

Not done:

- no source-audio verification, public export, deploy, Meilisearch reindex, commit, push, or release-gate run.

## 2026-06-18 — Public TikTok transcript polish ASR-review batches 001-003

User asked to process three ASR-review transcript polish batches under `hermes-polish-20260618-asr-review` using the GPT-5.5 quality lane.

Actions taken:

- checked worktree state and confirmed active Phase 2 transcript-polish/publication rules;
- read only the required project-memory files, the three named batch files, and the exact output files created/validated for this task;
- processed 21 TikTok videos from `batch-001.md`, `batch-002.md`, and `batch-003.md`;
- wrote 21 polished transcript files under `12_knowledge-base/sources/tiktok/transcripts/polished/`;
- wrote 21 QA JSON files under `12_knowledge-base/sources/tiktok/transcripts/polished-qa/`;
- used faithful polish only: punctuation, capitalization, sentence boundaries, paragraph breaks, and obvious duplicate caption-artifact cleanup;
- preserved uncertain ASR/source wording and marked those rows `needs_review`.

Verification:

- validated every QA JSON file parses as JSON;
- validated `model_tier` is `gpt-5.5` for all 21 rows;
- validated `meaning_added=false` for all 21 rows;
- validated polished word counts and paragraph counts against the written `.txt` files;
- final QA totals: 10 `pass`, 11 `needs_review`, 0 `failed`.

Not done:

- no source-audio verification, public export, deploy, Meilisearch reindex, commit, push, or release-gate run.

## 2026-06-18 — Public TikTok transcript polish batch 001

User asked to process `hermes-polish-20260618-034106/batch-001.md` using the GPT-5.5 quality lane and create/update one polished transcript plus one QA JSON per video.

Actions taken:

- read the required project-memory contract files, confirmed active Phase 2 transcript-polish rules, and checked the worktree before editing;
- processed 4 TikTok videos from the batch;
- wrote polished transcript files under `12_knowledge-base/sources/tiktok/transcripts/polished/`;
- wrote QA JSON files under `12_knowledge-base/sources/tiktok/transcripts/polished-qa/`;
- used faithful polish only: punctuation, capitalization, sentence boundaries, and paragraph breaks, with uncertain caption wording preserved.

Follow-up verification:

- downloaded temporary ignored audio for the 3 `needs_review` rows under `.planning/audio-review/`;
- ran local `faster-whisper` ASR from the project `.venv`;
- source-audio reviewed and corrected the uncertain caption phrases;
- `python3 scripts/tiktok-polish-status.py --batch-dir 12_knowledge-base/sources/tiktok/transcript-polish-batches/hermes-polish-20260618-034106 --json` passed with `needs_review=0`;
- `pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./scripts/hermes-tiktok-refresh.ps1 -AfterPolish -BatchSet hermes-polish-20260618-034106` completed;
- public export now has 1,392 source records and 1,911 passages with `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- public export policy and release contract passed.

Not done yet:

- deploy, Meilisearch reindex, live QA, commit, push, GSC submission, and IndexNow submission.

## 2026-06-18 — AHREFS-P1-06 social metadata deploy and source-detail H1 fix

User authorized the next safe deploy/cleanup step after the local-reviewed social metadata pass.

Actions taken:

- confirmed the current branch, dirty worktree, active phase, and deployment/publication boundaries before deploy;
- ran local publication-boundary, public export policy, GitHub metadata, Python syntax, diff whitespace, and OG/X metadata checks;
- packaged and deployed `base2026-social-metadata-ay38-20260618` as a data-preserving hotfix, then treated visual QA failures as a real release blocker instead of accepting the deploy;
- fixed the root cause: hydrated runtime source-detail pages now render the source-detail title as the single visible H1 and hide the search shell H1 only while source detail is open;
- packaged and deployed the corrected final release `base2026-social-metadata-h1-ay39-20260618`;
- kept Meilisearch reindex skipped because public data/index fields did not change.

Verification:

- package gates preserved counts: 1,388 source records, 1,906 passages, 1,623 insight cards, 1,052 public insight cards, 1,516 topics, 1,001 public topics, 5 creators, and 1,482 sitemap URLs across 4 sitemap files;
- publication-boundary audit passed with `forbidden=0`, `needs_review=0`, `secret_findings=0`;
- public export policy passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- live HTTP/asset smoke passed for `/knowledge/`, `/knowledge/api.html`, a source page, and sitemap;
- targeted live OG/X checks passed for representative root, API, analytics, topic, compare, creator, and source pages;
- targeted source-intelligence visual QA passed after the H1 fix;
- full live mobile visual QA passed: 78 checks, 0 failures;
- live SEO crawl gate passed: 500 crawled pages, 1,482 sitemap URLs, 0 P0 bad links, 0 crawled error pages.

Not done:

- no commit, push, TikTok intake, GSC submission, IndexNow submission, Ahrefs recrawl, or Meilisearch reindex.

## 2026-06-17 — Command-center agent workflow and parallel SEO/growth workers

User asked to stop losing tasks between long sessions, use Base2026 as a local public intelligence source for growth, and operate through scoped subagents/workers.

Actions taken:

- used the SEO/content/programmatic SEO/memory-management workflow guidance already installed in the Codex skills set;
- confirmed the worktree is dirty and no commit/deploy/intake action is authorized by this coordination task;
- added `docs/project-memory/AGENT_WORKFLOW.md` as the durable command-center/subagent operating model;
- updated `ACTIVE_QUEUE.md` with current worker lanes, current live release state, and the next execution order;
- started two scoped workers:
  - `Russell` for `SEO-02`, a local live SEO crawl gate to replace Ahrefs recrawl while quota is unavailable;
  - `Faraday` for `GROWTH-01`, a Base2026 public-dataset intelligence and growth plan.

Current rule:

- workers may produce local evidence and tracked docs/scripts inside their allowed scopes;
- command center must review before deploy, commit, push, GSC submission, IndexNow submission, or public promotion.

Follow-up review:

- reviewed Russell's `SEO-02` output;
- accepted `scripts/live-seo-crawl-gate.mjs` as public-safe tooling and added it to `scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py`;
- confirmed a 40-page command-center control crawl passes with 0 P0 bad links and 0 crawled error pages;
- confirmed the full worker crawl report shows 500 live pages, 1482 sitemap URLs, 0 P0 bad links, 0 crawled 4xx/5xx/fetch failures, and the next SEO issue class is incomplete OG/X-card metadata on 499 checked indexable pages;
- reran `python3 scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py`: `forbidden=0`, `needs_review=0`, `secret_findings=0`.

## 2026-06-17 — Ahrefs P0 SEO deploy pass

User asked to continue according to SEO skills and close the Ahrefs audit items as an experienced SEO operator, then approved the safe deploy path.

Actions taken:

- used the `seo-audit` skill and the existing Ahrefs backlog/cache;
- fixed the analytics link generator so `/knowledge/analytics.html` links to static source and creator pages instead of root-level 404 paths;
- changed generated Base2026 footer/contact links to point directly to `/ai-visibility-audit/` instead of redirecting `/contact/`;
- added WordPress author archive handling: `/author/` redirects to `/about/`, and WordPress author links are filtered to `/about/`;
- regenerated Base2026 info pages and generated public pages locally;
- packaged and deployed Base2026 as `base2026-ahrefs-p0-link-contracts-ay37-20260617`;
- deployed the WordPress `functions.php` author redirect with a server backup at `/root/alex-yarosh-file-backups/20260617-ahrefs-p0-author-redirect/`;
- updated the Ahrefs task CSV so P0 items are `deployed-pending-recrawl`, not prematurely marked closed.

Verification:

- Python compile passed for `scripts/generate-public-pages.py` and `scripts/generate-info-pages.py`;
- local generation passed for `scripts/generate-info-pages.py` and `scripts/generate-public-pages.py`;
- targeted `rg` checks found no root-level analytics source/topic query links and no generated/static Base2026 `/contact/` links;
- public release contract, public export policy, and publication-boundary audit passed;
- live HTTP smoke passed for root pages, `/knowledge/`, `/knowledge/analytics.html`, `/knowledge/api.html`, sitemap, source index, and creator index;
- live `/author/` returns 301 to `/about/`;
- live link smoke found no known Ahrefs P0 bad links in checked Base2026 and WordPress pages;
- sitemap exposes 1,482 URLs across 4 sitemap files and does not include `/contact/`;
- targeted `git diff --check` and `python3 scripts/validate-github-metadata.py` passed.

Not done:

- no commit, push, GSC submission, IndexNow submission, Ahrefs recrawl, or TikTok intake;
- Meilisearch reindex was intentionally skipped because public data/index fields did not change.

## 2026-06-17 — Source Intelligence empty-state investigation and full review

User reported that two `@webhivedigital` On-Page SEO source-detail workspace URLs showed Source Text but no Source Intelligence.

Actions taken:

- investigated both reported sources and confirmed they have public source text plus pending/private legacy insight rows, but no reviewed/public Source Intelligence cards;
- confirmed the issue was not creator-wide: `@webhivedigital` has public reviewed cards on other records;
- kept the six linked pending cards private because the on-page SEO claims depend partly on visual context and should pass the evidence-gated review path before publication;
- changed runtime and generated source-detail rendering so the `Source Intelligence` section is always present;
- added an honest empty state for sources with zero reviewed/public cards;
- added mobile visual QA coverage for both the empty-state and reviewed-card cases;
- ran a full review pass and recorded findings in `docs/project-memory/FULL_PROJECT_REVIEW_2026_06_17.md`.

Verification:

- syntax checks passed for `web/static/meili.js`, `scripts/mobile-visual-qa.mjs`, and `scripts/generate-public-pages.py`;
- temporary static generation passed;
- generated source pages for both reported URLs show the empty state;
- a control source with reviewed cards still shows Source Intelligence cards;
- intercepted-live Playwright runtime check passed on mobile and desktop using live HTML/JSONL plus local `meili.js`;
- public export policy, newest-source content readiness, release contract, GitHub metadata validation, KB audit, publication-boundary audit, and `git diff --check` passed.

Not done:

- no deploy, commit, push, reindex, or TikTok intake;
- full historical content-readiness remains red because 540 older source-only records lack topics/public insights; package-level newest-source readiness passes.

## 2026-06-16 — GSC daily quota reached

User reported the GSC response: `Sorry--we couldn't process this request because you've exceeded your daily quota. Please try submitting this again tomorrow.`

Actions taken:

- recorded the quota stop in `LAUNCH_COMMAND_CENTER.md`, `CURRENT_HANDOFF.md`, and `NEXT_ACTION.md`;
- kept the already confirmed clean submissions as:
  - `https://aggressorbulkit.online/knowledge/topics/ai-citations.html`;
  - `https://aggressorbulkit.online/knowledge/topics/ai-citation-tracking.html`;
  - `https://aggressorbulkit.online/knowledge/topics/ai-content-quality.html`;
- kept the remaining manual-after-reset candidates as:
  - `https://aggressorbulkit.online/knowledge/topics/ai-retrieval-behavior.html`;
  - `https://aggressorbulkit.online/knowledge/topics/backlink-quality.html`;
  - `https://aggressorbulkit.online/knowledge/topics/content-freshness.html`;
  - `https://aggressorbulkit.online/knowledge/topics/core-update-analysis.html`;
  - `https://aggressorbulkit.online/knowledge/topics/local-seo.html`.

Rule:

- do not keep retrying GSC today;
- continue tomorrow after GSC resets the daily `Request indexing` quota;
- browser automation for GSC input/clicking remains forbidden.

## 2026-06-15 — GSC automation stopped after unsafe live-browser behavior

User caught that browser automation was still targeting the wrong area in the live Chrome/GSC session.

Actions taken:

- stopped all GSC input/click automation;
- checked that no separate `osascript` GSC automation process was still running;
- updated `LAUNCH_COMMAND_CENTER.md`, `CURRENT_HANDOFF.md`, and `NEXT_ACTION.md` with a hard rule: Codex must not type or click in GSC through browser automation in this workflow;
- recorded confirmed clean URL submissions:
  - `https://aggressorbulkit.online/knowledge/topics/ai-citations.html`;
  - `https://aggressorbulkit.online/knowledge/topics/ai-citation-tracking.html`;
  - `https://aggressorbulkit.online/knowledge/topics/ai-content-quality.html`;
- recorded remaining manual-only candidates:
  - `https://aggressorbulkit.online/knowledge/topics/ai-retrieval-behavior.html`;
  - `https://aggressorbulkit.online/knowledge/topics/backlink-quality.html`;
  - `https://aggressorbulkit.online/knowledge/topics/content-freshness.html`;
  - `https://aggressorbulkit.online/knowledge/topics/core-update-analysis.html`;
  - `https://aggressorbulkit.online/knowledge/topics/local-seo.html`.

Rule going forward:

- GSC URL entry and `REQUEST INDEXING` clicks are manual-only in the user's live browser;
- Codex may only read status from an already-open GSC page if explicitly asked;
- do not retry direct raw GSC inspect links because they are proven invalid for this workflow.

## 2026-06-15 — Context-loop control and command-center plan

User called out the repeated loop where Codex rereads the same long project-memory files after compaction, wastes context, then restarts discovery.

Actions taken:

- added an anti-loop resume protocol to `docs/project-memory/CURRENT_HANDOFF.md`;
- added a context budget plan to `docs/project-memory/LAUNCH_COMMAND_CENTER.md`;
- marked the three read-only subagent audits as completed/accepted in the command center;
- updated `NEXT_ACTION.md` so future resumes read only `AGENTS.md`, `CURRENT_HANDOFF.md`, `LAUNCH_COMMAND_CENTER.md`, bounded git status, and task-specific files unless a real conflict or release gate requires more.

Rule going forward:

- `CURRENT_HANDOFF.md` is the compact current-state file;
- `LAUNCH_COMMAND_CENTER.md` is the live task board;
- generated `web/static/**` is inspected only through representative pages or targeted diffs;
- main Codex continues from the first incomplete command-center row instead of rediscovering the project.

## 2026-06-14 — Base2026 analytics, Geist typography, compact IA, live deploy

User asked to reduce Base2026 navigation/button chaos, switch to Vercel Geist-style typography, add compact cross-library analytics, keep creators/results/source actions understandable, and deploy live after tests.

Actions taken:

- added public analytics generation from public JSONL artifacts only;
- added `/knowledge/analytics.html` and analytics JSON to package/deploy;
- switched Base2026 runtime and generated pages to Geist / Geist Mono;
- added compact product nav and analytics strip to `/knowledge/`;
- added compact result-level topic/creator counts without adding extra result CTAs;
- changed result CTA copy to `Open source`;
- kept source detail in the route-driven workspace, not a modal;
- fixed Source Intelligence evidence expansion so clipped public insight evidence can expand from related passages/source text;
- restored mobile `site-header__mobile-base` submenu compatibility and wrapped product nav on mobile;
- packaged and deployed `base2026-analytics-geist-20260614`.

Verification:

- syntax checks, `git diff --check`, publication boundary audit, GitHub metadata validation, public export policy, public text excerpt validation, and public release contract passed;
- release package generated 1,305 sitemap URLs and analytics artifacts;
- live smoke confirmed release marker, Geist, analytics page, analytics JSON, and mobile submenu;
- Base2026-only live mobile visual QA passed with 30 checks and 0 failures;
- targeted live browser check confirmed analytics strip visible, no legacy modal, full source text, and non-clipped Source Intelligence evidence.

Not done:

- no TikTok intake was run;
- no Meilisearch reindex was run because passage/index data did not change;
- no git staging, commit, or push was performed.

## 2026-06-14 — WordPress homepage design-system pass

User clarified that the homepage still looked inconsistent: `Why free`, `After the call`, `Fit`, and `Quick request` used different x-offsets, type sizes, list treatments, and dividers. User also asked to document the workflow: inspect first, plan, implement, deploy live, verify, and only then report done.

Outcome:

- audited live homepage metrics with Playwright before editing
- confirmed the mismatch: roadmap section labels started at different x-positions, normal lists used mixed `18px`/`14.5px` text, and `Why free`/`Fit` had horizontal list dividers
- updated live WordPress child-theme CSS to `style.css?ver=1.5.43`
- replaced the previous homepage override with a design-system pass: one panel grid, one internal padding/alignment, one list type scale, no normal-list dividers, consistent section CTAs, equal footer CTAs
- cleared Cache Enabler generated cache for `aggressorbulkit.online`
- verified live Home/Services/Pricing/About/AI Visibility Audit on desktop and mobile: HTTP 200, `style.css?ver=1.5.43`, Rank Math title/description present, no horizontal overflow
- verified homepage metrics: section labels align at `x=293` desktop and `x=29` mobile; normal list dividers are `0px`; list text is `16px` desktop and `14px` mobile
- documented the durable workflow in `WORDPRESS_DESIGN_SYSTEM_WORKFLOW_2026_06_14.md` and added a design-system decision

## 2026-06-14 — WordPress homepage polish

User asked to polish the live WordPress homepage: remove the framed hero contract plaque, simplify the `Why free`/`After the call`/`Fit` sections, replace weak `All good.` copy, make the Base2026 promo use the acid-green block treatment, align footer CTA buttons, deploy immediately, and confirm Rank Math remained healthy.

Outcome:

- edited live WordPress page `Home` through Novamira, replacing `All good.` with `Send the basics.`
- updated live child-theme `style.css` from version `1.5.41` to `1.5.42`
- added homepage polish CSS for transparent white italic hero terms, cleaner roadmap list rhythm, tighter quick-request copy spacing, green Base2026 block emphasis, and equal footer CTA sizing
- cleared Cache Enabler generated cache for `aggressorbulkit.online`
- verified live desktop/mobile with Playwright: HTTP 200, `style.css?ver=1.5.42`, Rank Math title/description present, requested copy/style changes visible, and no horizontal overflow

## 2026-06-06 — Project control system

User asked to adapt a separate project-control pattern for Base2026, create a durable todo/control system, and use a strict reviewer role.

Outcome:

- created `AGENTS.md`
- created `docs/project-memory/`
- created status board, phases, handoff template, public/private boundary, deploy runbook, Hermes runbook, and reviewer protocol
- set next action to first public-safe git commit preparation

## 2026-06-06 — First public-safe commit prep

User confirmed moving by the new project-control scheme and approved doing the next step.

Outcome:

- staged only public-safe files
- strengthened `.gitignore`
- sanitized deployment docs and agent prompts to remove local absolute paths and concrete server host
- rewrote `README.md` for the public TikTok/video knowledge product
- reviewer pass found no forbidden staged private paths

## 2026-06-06 — Hermes model-routed refresh

User asked to split Hermes work by model tier and avoid GPT-5.5 token waste.

Outcome:

- documented Hermes model routing: GPT-5.3/no LLM for mechanics, GPT-5.4 for normal faithful polish, GPT-5.5 only for escalation
- ran local Hermes refresh without deploy
- pulled captions for two queued videos; ASR was not needed
- created polish batch `hermes-polish-20260606-164846`
- ran Hermes worker with model `gpt-5.4`
- wrote polished outputs and QA for two newest videos
- corrected two QA items using source verification instead of GPT-5.5
- patched `tiktok-polish-status.py` and `hermes-tiktok-refresh.ps1` so `-AfterPolish` checks only the current batch instead of failing on historical `needs_review` items
- ran `-AfterPolish` for `hermes-polish-20260606-164846`
- rebuilt SQLite, audit passed, exported 942 documents and 1371 chunks
- reindexed local Meilisearch and deployed/reindexed VPS release `base2026-public-hermes-20260606-1705`
- verified remote search finds both new TikTok videos

## 2026-06-06 — Hermes reliability and UI backlog

User asked to fix Hermes WebUI reliability, add lean worker path, close pipeline tails, keep the guide updated, and record the weak visual UI as the next serious workstream.

Outcome:

- repaired `Hermes WebUI` scheduled task by switching action to absolute `C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe` and setting working directory
- added `scripts/register-hermes-webui-task.ps1` for reproducible WebUI task repair/start
- added `scripts/run-hermes-polish-worker.ps1` for durable GPT-5.4 batch polish handoff with ignored `.planning/` logs
- fixed ASR fallback media detection to accept mp3/mp4/m4a/webm/wav
- marked two no-audio fallback videos as `needs_source_review` instead of endless `needs_asr`
- verified `needs_asr=0`, `queued_asr_jobs=0`, and `kb-audit.py` PASS after rebuild
- moved active phase to Public web UI visual-system pass and created `UI_VISUAL_BACKLOG.md`

## 2026-06-07 — Hermes-free transcription research synthesis

User supplied three external research outputs about TikTok/Instagram transcription without Hermes.

Outcome:

- created `docs/research/TRANSCRIPTION_PIPELINE_OPTIONS.md`
- set recommendation: local worker handles scraping/download/ASR; VPS handles ingest/search/UI
- confirmed Hermes is local prototype only, not production dependency
- updated next action to design/run 40-video PoC before UI/GitHub production hardening

## 2026-06-07 — Zero-paid-token local worker architecture

User asked how to avoid paid subscriptions and paid LLM/token usage for daily TikTok/Instagram ingestion.

Outcome:

- created `docs/research/LOCAL_WORKER_AUTOMATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- set daily ingestion default to local tools: extractor, `ffmpeg`, local ASR, deterministic cleanup, token guard, JSONL upload
- local LLM is optional and configurable through a local endpoint; paid LLMs are manual fallback only
- Codex role clarified as command center/debugger/reviewer, not daily scheduled worker

## 2026-06-07 — Local LLM, creator admin, and open-source positioning

User asked which local LLM should clean transcripts, how Hermes should use it, how new creators should be added, and how to prepare GitHub without AI slop.

Outcome:

- created `docs/research/LOCAL_LLM_CLEANUP_LAYER.md`
- selected Gemma 4 12B as primary local cleanup LLM target, with model configurable by endpoint
- created `docs/research/CREATOR_ADMIN_FLOW.md`
- created `docs/project-memory/HERMES_LOCAL_OPERATOR_GUIDE.md`
- created `docs/project-memory/OPEN_SOURCE_POSITIONING.md`
- clarified that stop-slop applies to public docs/UI copy, not faithful transcript rewriting

## 2026-06-07 — faster-whisper local worker smoke test

User asked to connect ASR and implement the real transcribe path.

Outcome:

- confirmed `faster-whisper` Python package is installed and importable
- updated `scripts/base2026-worker.py transcribe` to use the Python API, not a missing CLI binary
- added transcript text, segments JSON, and ASR metadata outputs
- smoke-tested one existing local audio fallback with `small.en`, `cpu`, `int8`
- result: ~88.8 seconds audio transcribed in ~50 seconds, 327 words, cleanup guard passed

## 2026-06-07 — Public content risk and positioning review

User supplied an external ChatGPT review of Base2026's public-product idea and asked for an engineering opinion.

Outcome:

- agreed with the core critique: the public project must not become a transcript dump or SEO farm;
- created `docs/research/PUBLIC_CONTENT_RISK_MODEL.md`;
- created `docs/research/EXTERNAL_REVIEW_PROMPT.md`;
- updated public/private publication boundary;
- set durable decision: public layer is attributed excerpts, source records, topic/insight cards, comparison views, methodology, and opt-out/correction; full third-party transcripts are private/local by default.

## 2026-06-07 — Attributed intelligence architecture pass

User approved the new public-safe direction and asked to lay the new architecture and continue work.

Outcome:

- created `docs/research/ATTRIBUTED_INTELLIGENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md`;
- created `docs/schemas/PUBLIC_JSONL_SCHEMA.md`;
- changed `scripts/export-public-tiktok.py` so full transcripts are not exported by default;
- added compatibility export files plus new architecture files: `source_records.jsonl`, `passages.jsonl`, and empty `insight_cards.jsonl`;
- smoke-tested public export into `.planning`: 943 source records, 1371 passages, `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- updated `web/static/meili.html` and `web/static/meili.js` from `Full transcript` language to source-record/excerpt-first language;
- updated project memory to treat public attribution architecture as part of the current research gate.

## 2026-06-07 — Deterministic insight-card baseline

User asked what a Microsoft-style engineer would do next: simple, efficient, low-token, checked, and plan-following.

Outcome:

- implemented zero-LLM `insight_cards.jsonl` export from existing claims;
- added deterministic evidence excerpt matching against passages;
- kept all current insight cards `public=false` because all claims are currently `pending`;
- added `scripts/check-public-export-policy.py`;
- smoke-tested export: 943 source records, 1371 passages, 1538 insight cards, 0 public insight cards, no full transcripts in excerpt-only export.

## 2026-06-07 — MVP release candidate with full transcript drawer

User clarified the desired UI behavior: result cards can show excerpts, but clicking the source record should open the full transcript.

Outcome:

- package script now exports deploy data with `--include-full-transcripts` and validates export policy;
- package script auto-promotes high-confidence insight cards;
- added methodology and opt-out pages to `web/static/`;
- added navigation links to the search UI;
- built local release candidate `base2026-public-mvp-smoke`;
- local release validation: 943 source records, 1371 passages, 1538 insight cards, 1097 public insight cards;
- HTTP checks passed for index, methodology, opt-out, and documents JSONL;
- uploaded release zip to VPS through SSH alias `geo-contabo`;
- deployed `/var/www/base2026-knowledge/releases/base2026-public-mvp-smoke`;
- reindexed Meilisearch: 1371 passages;
- switched `/var/www/base2026-knowledge/current`;
- nginx config test passed and nginx reloaded;
- server HTTP checks passed for `/knowledge/`, `/knowledge/methodology.html`, `/knowledge/opt-out.html`, and full-transcript `documents.jsonl`;
- Meilisearch search check passed for `AI Overviews`;
- browser MCP timed out, so screenshot QA remains pending.

## 2026-06-07 — Live search proxy and main-site visual remediation

User reported that the deployed `/knowledge/` page looked visually weak and returned no visible results.

Outcome:

- confirmed the empty result issue was real: `/knowledge-search/multi-search` was missing the Meilisearch Authorization header through nginx;
- fixed nginx on the VPS so the search key is injected server-side, without exposing the key in browser code;
- deployed release `base2026-public-mainstyle-fix`;
- restyled the public UI toward the main site system: dark shell, Manrope/Space Grotesk typography, header/footer, stronger controls, chips, result cards, facets, and source buttons;
- rebuilt and deployed the public package with 943 source records, 1371 passages, 1538 insight cards, and 1097 public insight cards;
- reindexed Meilisearch and verified public search for `AI Overviews`: 807 hits;
- captured live JS-loaded screenshot evidence at `output/releases/base2026-public-mainstyle-fix-live-wait.png`;
- remaining UI work: mobile screenshot QA and further visual polish after user review.

## 2026-06-08 — Light main-site UI correction and TikTok creator discovery

User rejected the dark `AI-Visibility` knowledge UI because it did not match the main WordPress site now served at `https://aggressorbulkit.online/`.

Outcome:

- inspected the main WordPress site style through browser automation;
- recorded the actual main-site visual direction: `Source Sans 3`, warm off-white background, dark charcoal text, orange CTA, dark-green primary buttons, 8px controls, compact sticky header;
- changed local `web/static/meili.html` and `web/static/styles.css` to the light Alex Yarosh-compatible design system;
- changed local methodology and opt-out pages to the same visual system;
- discovered TikTok profile data and first video URL queues for `@joshuamaraney` and `@webhivedigital`;
- confirmed individual TikTok video pages expose useful caption/meta text while browser `textTracks` are empty;
- created `docs/project-memory/TIKTOK_DISCOVERY_2026_06_08.md`;
- created `docs/project-memory/NEW_CREATOR_INTAKE_RUNBOOK.md`;
- created `docs/project-memory/NIGHT_RUN_2026_06_08.md`;
- created `config/tiktok-intake-queue.20260608.json`;
- created `scripts/tiktok-caption-browser-extract.mjs`;
- created `docs/schemas/TIKTOK_INTAKE_RECORD_SCHEMA.md`;
- created `docs/project-memory/TIKTOK_INTAKE_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`;
- created `docs/project-memory/VISUAL_SYSTEM_CONTRACT.md`;
- created `docs/project-memory/AY_STYLE_DEPLOY_CHECKLIST.md`;
- created `config/release-target.20260608-ay-style.json`;
- blocker: shell runner failed with `windows sandbox: spawn setup refresh`, so release packaging, SSH deploy, Python validation, and actual intake execution remain pending.

## 2026-06-08 — ay3 public UI deploy and TikTok staging import

User restarted the task with full local permissions and asked to continue visibly without degraded direction.

Outcome:

- fixed `scripts/package-public-release.ps1` so cache-bust URLs are replaced generically instead of hardcoded old versions;
- switched the live UI to cache-bust `20260608-ay3`;
- fixed empty first-screen search by enabling `placeholderSearch: true` in `web/static/meili.js`;
- fixed mobile header overflow by hiding the full nav under the mobile breakpoint;
- fixed the stretched source-dialog `Close` button by aligning the dialog header to flex-start;
- moved mobile results above filters for a more useful search-first flow;
- verified public export policy: 957 source records, 1392 passages, 1538 insight cards, 1097 public insight cards;
- deployed VPS release `base2026-public-ay-style-ay3`;
- verified `/knowledge/` is no longer empty: empty query returns 1392 passages and populated facets;
- verified search `Search Console Josh`: 670 passages, first visible result from `@joshuamaraney`;
- verified source dialog loads a polished `@joshuamaraney` transcript and direct original/copy controls;
- verified mobile QA: no horizontal overflow, nav hidden, results before filters;
- screenshot evidence saved under `output/evidence/knowledge-live-ay3-*.png`;
- current ingestion state: 68 staged TikTok URLs checked, 14 new `@joshuamaraney` records imported, 12 duplicates skipped, 36 records need ASR, 5 out-of-scope candidates, 1 short caption.

## 2026-06-08 — ChatGPT public-product review and caption preview fix

User supplied the external ChatGPT product critique again and pointed out that `Platform caption` looked clipped on the live site.

Outcome:

- confirmed the pasted critique matches the existing strategic decision: Base2026 should be an attributed intelligence/source layer, not a public transcript dump;
- created `docs/project-memory/PUBLIC_PRODUCT_GAP_REVIEW_2026_06_08.md`;
- identified that the live `Platform caption` text is truncated in the available TikTok metadata itself, not just CSS;
- changed UI copy to `Platform caption preview` when metadata ends in `...`;
- added a visible note explaining that the caption metadata is truncated and that the source record/original post should be used for full context;
- deployed release `base2026-public-ay-style-ay4`;
- verified live `/knowledge/?q=Search%20Console%20Josh`: 670 passages, first creator `@joshuamaraney`, caption summary `Platform caption preview`, warning note visible;
- clarified creator count: current queue had one new creator, `@joshuamaraney`; the second queued block was `@webhivedigital`, an existing creator refresh, so the live count of 4 creators is correct for processed data.

## 2026-06-08 — Public intelligence implementation planning

User asked to stop patching and implement the full public-product idea as a serious open-source/grant-ready project.

Outcome:

- researched current anchors: Google people-first/spam guidance, Google `VideoObject`, Schema.org `Claim`/`ClaimReview`, Meilisearch filters/facets and multi-search/federated search, GitHub repository best practices, and OpenSSF Scorecard;
- created `docs/project-memory/PUBLIC_INTELLIGENCE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_2026_06_08.md`;
- set active phase to public intelligence layer implementation;
- set next execution target to static creator/source pages generated from public JSONL;
- preserved ASR fallback as a parallel ingestion task, not the immediate product/UI task.

## 2026-06-08 — Creator and source pages shipped

Outcome:

- added `scripts/generate-public-pages.py`;
- release package now generates static creator pages under `/knowledge/creators/`;
- release package now generates excerpt-first source pages under `/knowledge/sources/`;
- search results now include `Source page` and `Creator page` links;
- source pages include original link, creator link, excerpt, related passages, safe JSON-LD, and a full-transcript guard;
- generated 4 creator pages and 957 source pages in the release package;
- deployed `base2026-public-intel-pages-ay5`;
- verified live `Search Console Josh` result links to `/knowledge/sources/tiktok-video-7647809342548266258.html`;
- verified source page loads, has JSON-LD, and does not present raw/full transcript as standalone public content.

Outcome:

- added deterministic `topics.jsonl` export from source-backed insight cards and passage topic fields;
- added topic policy validation to `scripts/check-public-export-policy.py`;
- added generated topic pages under `/knowledge/topics/{topic_id}.html`;
- added generated comparison pages under `/knowledge/compare/{topic_id}.html`;
- changed public package default to excerpt-only; full transcripts now require explicit `-IncludeFullTranscripts` for private/gated review exports;
- updated Meilisearch index settings so `topic_labels` are searchable and `topics` are filterable;
- added topic chips to live search result cards;
- deployed `base2026-public-intel-pages-ay6`;
- reindexed VPS Meilisearch with 1392 passages and topic fields;
- verified live `/knowledge/?q=AI%20Overviews`: 922 hits, 20 rendered result cards, 31 topic chips, no console errors;
- verified live topic page `/knowledge/topics/local-seo-google-business-profile.html`: `index,follow`, 10 cards, compare link present;
- verified live compare page `/knowledge/compare/local-seo-google-business-profile.html`: `index,follow`, 3 creator groups;
- verified singleton topic pages are `noindex,follow` and excluded from topic index pages;
- verified live `/knowledge/static/documents.jsonl`: 957 records checked, `transcript_leaks=0`;
- verified source dialog now shows `Platform caption preview`, `Public evidence excerpt`, and the private-transcript policy note instead of `Transcript text`;
- screenshot evidence saved under `output/evidence/knowledge-live-ay6-*.png`;
- next phase: GitHub/open-source readiness and publication audit.

## 2026-06-08 — Open-source readiness checkpoint

Outcome:

- rewrote `README.md` around the current local-first, excerpt-first public intelligence architecture;
- added `CONTRIBUTING.md`;
- added `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`;
- rewrote `SECURITY.md` for the current read-only public demo;
- added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for Python and JavaScript syntax checks;
- updated `.env.example` to use `base2026_public_tiktok`;
- added `scripts/deploy-public-vps.ps1` for repeatable VPS deploys;
- fixed `scripts/package-public-release.ps1` to write Linux-friendly zip archives with POSIX paths instead of Windows backslash entries;
- tested `scripts/deploy-public-vps.ps1` against `base2026-public-intel-pages-ay6`;
- fixed deploy failure handling so native command errors fail the PowerShell script;
- fixed Meilisearch master-key handling by stripping CR/LF in both deploy script and `scripts/meili-index-public.py`;
- updated `.gitignore`, `docs/GIT_PUBLICATION_AUDIT.md`, and `docs/project-memory/PUBLICATION_BOUNDARY.md` so `config/creators.example.json` can be public-safe while release targets and TikTok intake queues remain ignored;
- added `docs/PUBLICATION_STAGING_PLAN.md` to prevent accidental `git add .`;
- added `scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py` as a repeatable public/private staging gate;
- added `docs/PUBLICATION_AUDIT_REPORT_2026_06_08.md`;
- added `docs/LICENSE_DECISION_NOTES.md`;
- added `docs/GITHUB_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md`;
- added `scripts/preflight-github-launch.ps1`;
- added `scripts/stage-public-files.ps1`;
- added `scripts/apply-license.ps1`;
- current audit result: 70 changed files, 70 public-safe candidates, 0 needs-review, 0 forbidden paths, 0 secret findings;
- default launch preflight now intentionally fails until `LICENSE` exists;
- audit-only preflight passes with `-SkipLicenseCheck`: publication audit, Python syntax, JavaScript syntax, PowerShell parse, public export policy, live search proxy;
- staging helper dry-run passes with `-SkipLicenseCheck`, covers all public-safe changed files, and refuses actual launch staging unless `LICENSE` exists;
- verification passed: Python syntax, JS syntax, PowerShell parse, public export policy, live deploy script, and basic secret grep.

Remaining before GitHub:

- license choice;
- GitHub remote target;
- final staged diff/publication audit;
- then stage only public-safe files.

## 2026-06-08 — Public source-record contract hardening

User asked to implement the external GPT critique instead of shipping a public transcript/caption dump.

Outcome:

- changed the public data contract so `documents.jsonl`, `source_records.jsonl`, `chunks.jsonl`, and `passages.jsonl` no longer include raw `claims` fields;
- strengthened `scripts/check-public-export-policy.py` so excerpt-only exports fail if source records or passages leak `claims`;
- kept full transcripts private by default: regenerated public export has 957 source records, 1392 passages, `claims_field=0`, and `transcripts=0` in public source/passages files;
- changed the search source dialog into an attributed source record: public policy, platform, language, topics, public evidence excerpt, original/source/creator links, and platform-caption metadata below the evidence text;
- removed inline `Platform caption` from result cards so truncated platform metadata is not mistaken for primary evidence;
- added query highlighting inside opened public evidence excerpts and set Meilisearch highlight tags to `<mark>`;
- changed generated source pages so H1 is stable attribution text such as `@tjrobertson52 source record`, while platform titles/captions stay in supporting copy/cards;
- renamed misleading `Reviewed` UI wording to `Public Insight Cards` where cards can be auto evidence-matched;
- packaged smoke release `base2026-ui-contract-check` passed: main search HTML present, static documents present, sample source page has stable H1, public excerpt, public insight cards, and full-transcript warning;
- GitHub metadata validator passes;
- publication audit now reports 78 changed files, 78 public-safe candidates, 0 needs-review, 0 forbidden, 0 secret findings;
- audit-only preflight passes with `-SkipLicenseCheck`; default preflight still blocks until `LICENSE` exists;
- staging dry-run passes with `stage_path_count=42` and does not stage without `-Apply`.

Remaining:

- choose license;
- choose GitHub remote/repo name;
- run final launch preflight without `-SkipLicenseCheck`;
- stage public-safe files only after license exists.

## 2026-06-08 — ay7 public source-record deploy

Outcome:

- packaged excerpt-only release `base2026-public-source-record-ay7`;
- deployed ay7 to VPS and switched `/var/www/base2026-knowledge/current`;
- nginx config test and reload passed;
- reindexed Meilisearch with 1392 passages;
- verified live `/knowledge/` returns the search UI and uses `/knowledge-search`;
- verified live sample source page `/knowledge/sources/tiktok-video-7388244947352210734.html` has H1 `@tjrobertson52 source record`, no stale `Reviewed` wording, `Public Evidence Excerpt`, `Public Insight Cards`, and the full-transcript warning;
- verified live `/knowledge/static/documents.jsonl`: 957 rows, `claims_field=0`, `transcripts=0`;
- verified live `/knowledge-search/multi-search` for `AI Overviews`: 922 hits, topic fields present;
- ran Playwright visual smoke checks on desktop and mobile: 20 rendered results, 20 source buttons, no horizontal overflow, source dialog opens with policy/excerpt/caption metadata;
- saved screenshots:
  - `output/evidence/knowledge-live-ay7-desktop.png`
  - `output/evidence/knowledge-live-ay7-mobile.png`
  - `output/evidence/knowledge-live-ay7-source-dialog.png`.

Remaining:

- GitHub launch still needs license and remote decision.

## 2026-06-08 — GitHub launch preflight live-data guard

Outcome:

- strengthened `scripts/preflight-github-launch.ps1` so live checks now validate both `/knowledge-search/multi-search` and `/knowledge/static/documents.jsonl`;
- fixed the first implementation after reviewer pass: PowerShell returned `documents.Content` as `byte[]`, so the script now decodes UTF-8 explicitly before counting JSONL rows;
- verified audit-only preflight passes with:
  - live search hits: 922
  - live documents rows: 957
  - claimLeaks: 0
  - transcriptLeaks: 0;
- updated GitHub launch checklist and publication audit report with the new guard.

Remaining:

- `LICENSE` is still intentionally missing until maintainer chooses `Apache-2.0` or `MIT`;
- `git remote -v` is empty.

## 2026-06-08 — GitHub remote guard

Outcome:

- added `-SkipRemoteCheck` to `scripts/preflight-github-launch.ps1` for interim audit runs;
- default launch preflight now requires GitHub `origin` remote after the license check;
- added `-SkipRemoteCheck` passthrough to `scripts/stage-public-files.ps1`;
- verified audit-only preflight passes with `-SkipLicenseCheck -SkipRemoteCheck`;
- verified remote guard blocks launch checks when `origin` is missing;
- updated `docs/GITHUB_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md`, `docs/PUBLICATION_AUDIT_REPORT_2026_06_08.md`, and `docs/project-memory/NEXT_ACTION.md` to use the new audit-only commands.

Remaining:

- choose `Apache-2.0` or `MIT`;
- add GitHub `origin` remote.

## 2026-06-08 — ay8 public roadmap and policy pages

User provided `docs/base2026_roadmap_pack.zip` with public roadmap/story/privacy/source-policy/support/site-structure Markdown and asked to publish the pages in the Base2026 site style, with Roadmap visible near the top.

Outcome:

- extracted public page source Markdown into `docs/public-pages/`;
- added `scripts/generate-info-pages.py` to generate `roadmap.html`, `story.html`, `privacy.html`, `source-policy.html`, `support.html`, and `site-structure.html`;
- linked Roadmap visibly from the `/knowledge/` hero and added footer links for roadmap, methodology, source policy, privacy, support, and creator opt-out;
- updated `scripts/package-public-release.ps1` so public info pages are regenerated and copied into every release package;
- updated `scripts/deploy-public-vps.ps1` so deploy fails if key info pages are missing;
- ignored the imported source ZIP with `docs/*_roadmap_pack.zip` and kept generated release zips out of GitHub;
- deployed `base2026-public-info-pages-ay8` to VPS;
- verified live HTTP 200 for `/knowledge/`, `/knowledge/roadmap.html`, `/knowledge/story.html`, `/knowledge/privacy.html`, `/knowledge/source-policy.html`, `/knowledge/support.html`, `/knowledge/site-structure.html`, `/knowledge/methodology.html`, and `/knowledge/opt-out.html`;
- verified live `/knowledge-search/multi-search` for `AI Overviews`: 922 hits;
- verified live browser render: 20 search results for `AI Overviews`, no horizontal overflow, Roadmap visible, Roadmap has 6 phase cards, mobile Support page renders.

Evidence:

- `output/evidence/base2026-info-pages-ay8-live-home-results.png`
- `output/evidence/base2026-info-pages-ay8-live-roadmap.png`
- `output/evidence/base2026-info-pages-ay8-live-support-mobile.png`

Remaining:

- choose license;
- add GitHub `origin` remote;
- run final preflight and stage public-safe files when maintainer approves.

## 2026-06-08 — ay9 Alex Yarosh header/footer and license pass

User reviewed the public pages and requested:

- remove smart apostrophe/quote/dash artifacts from Roadmap/Privacy/source pages;
- add `offflinerpsy@gmail.com` to correction/removal request copy;
- make Base2026 header/footer match the Alex Yarosh ecosystem;
- add Base2026 to the main WordPress header;
- add Roadmap/Base2026 links and orange Roadmap CTA in the footer;
- remove pill/oval active/hover state from the main header navigation;
- choose the recommended open-source license.

Outcome:

- added correction/removal email to privacy/source/site-structure/opt-out copy and footer contact links;
- deployed `base2026-public-header-footer-ay9` to VPS;
- reindexed Meilisearch with 1392 passages;
- selected and applied Apache-2.0 license;
- updated the Alex Yarosh WordPress source project (`C:\Users\Makkaroshka\Desktop\geo`) with Base2026 main nav link, footer Roadmap links/CTA, and text-only orange active/hover state;
- deployed WordPress theme/import changes and bumped theme CSS to `1.5.2`.

Verification:

- `python .\scripts\audit-publication-boundary.py`: changed files 92, forbidden 0, secret findings 0;
- `scripts/preflight-github-launch.ps1 -SkipRemoteCheck`: pass;
- live `/knowledge/?q=AI Overview`: 20 rendered cards, creator facets present, CSS `20260608-ay9`;
- live `/knowledge/roadmap.html`: no smart quote/dash characters in rendered text;
- live WordPress home: Base2026 header link present, footer Base2026/Roadmap links and CTA present, active header state has transparent background and no pill/shadow;
- only observed console error: existing `/favicon.ico` 404.

Remaining:

- run the dedicated Roadmap scrollytelling redesign task for `/knowledge/roadmap.html`;
- add GitHub `origin` remote and run final launch preflight without skip flags;
- stage public-safe files only after final review.

## 2026-06-08 — ay10 roadmap scrollytelling redesign

User provided a dedicated roadmap redesign prompt and asked to run it after the header/footer/license work.

Inventory:

- current roadmap page was generated Markdown HTML from `docs/public-pages/01_ROADMAP.md`;
- related CSS lived in `web/static/styles.css`;
- no dedicated roadmap JS existed;
- global header/footer came from `scripts/generate-info-pages.py`.

Outcome:

- added a custom roadmap experience to `scripts/generate-info-pages.py` while preserving the generated Markdown as readable no-JS fallback;
- added `web/static/roadmap.js` with a structured `roadmapItems` array;
- roadmap JS renders phase navigation, milestone cards, status badges, quarter labels, expandable milestone details, and active section behavior;
- added CSS for a premium dark technical/product roadmap block, vertical progress rail, soft cards, sticky phase nav, and mobile accordion behavior;
- updated `scripts/package-public-release.ps1` so `roadmap.js` ships with releases;
- deployed `base2026-roadmap-scrolly-ay10`.

What was intentionally not used:

- no Motion/GSAP/third-party animation library; native CSS and IntersectionObserver were sufficient and cheaper/performance-safer;
- no Mermaid/Frappe/full roadmap app because the page needs public product storytelling, not dependency/task scheduling.

Verification:

- `node --check web\static\roadmap.js`: pass;
- `python -m py_compile scripts\generate-info-pages.py`: pass;
- local release QA: desktop/tablet/mobile, no console errors, no mobile overflow after fix;
- live `/knowledge/roadmap.html?qa=ay10`: 6 cards, nav Now/Next/Scale/Platform, statuses Done/In progress/Planned/Research, 6 details blocks, fallback present, desktop/mobile overflowX false, console errors 0;
- deployed ay10, nginx config test passed, Meilisearch reindexed with 1392 passages.

Known limitations:

- roadmap copy is still curated static data in `roadmap.js`; future changes should keep `docs/public-pages/01_ROADMAP.md` and `roadmapItems` aligned until a shared data source is introduced;
- fallback is readable but not as visually rich without JS.

Next:

- add GitHub `origin` remote and run final launch preflight without skip flags.

## 2026-06-09 — ay11b public info page visual normalization

User rejected the ay10 dark roadmap as visually inconsistent and requested the public info pages to match the main Base2026/Alex Yarosh visual system.

Outcome:

- removed the dark standalone roadmap treatment and restyled it as a light, clean Base2026 product section;
- kept structured `web/static/roadmap.js` and interactive cards, but changed the visual layer to warm surfaces, orange accents, restrained borders, and matching spacing;
- normalized all public info pages through shared `page-hero`, `content-section`, and footer button styles;
- changed footer CTA markup from mixed `hero-actions` / `ay-button-orange` to consistent `ay-actions` / `ay-button`;
- bumped cache-bust to `20260609-ay11` in generators, static pages, and release packaging;
- deployed `base2026-info-pages-clean-ay11b`.

Verification:

- live roadmap loads `styles.css?v=20260609-ay11` and `roadmap.js?v=20260609-ay11`;
- roadmap has 6 cards, no dark block, no desktop/mobile horizontal overflow;
- privacy page has correction email and matching 42px footer buttons;
- `/knowledge/?q=AI Overview` still renders 20 results and creator facets;
- publication audit and preflight pass with only remote check skipped.

## 2026-06-09 — separate roadmap data-visualization test page

User requested a complete roadmap rethink using the requested `build-web-data-visualization` plugin, without touching anything else, and asked to use the original Markdown roadmap data.

Finding:

- `build-web-data-visualization` was not available in installed or installable plugins for this session.
- The original source file exists at `docs/public-pages/01_ROADMAP.md`.

Outcome:

- updated only the separate test page assets:
  - `web/static/roadmap-dataviz-test.html`
  - `web/static/roadmap-dataviz-test.css`
  - `web/static/roadmap-dataviz-test.js`
- replaced internal todo-like roadmap wording with public product maturity wording;
- changed Phase 1 to `Public Trust Foundation`;
- reorganized the test data into six public-facing phases: trust foundation, ingestion pipeline, AI knowledge layer, creator/rights controls, analytics/signals, and monetization;
- added status badges for `Live`, `In progress`, `Next`, `Planned`, and `Research`;
- added top Now/Next/Later summary strip;
- added final `What this roadmap proves` section;
- added a no-JS fallback list of phases.

Verification:

- `node --check web/static/roadmap-dataviz-test.js`: pass;
- local Playwright desktop/mobile: 1 H1, 6 phase tabs, 6 SVG nodes, 3 summary cards, no forbidden `Publish Roadmap`-style todo wording, no horizontal overflow, console errors 0;
- JS-disabled mobile fallback: readable, 6 phases, no horizontal overflow.

## 2026-06-09 — services page editorial width fix

User marked the Services page editorial system block in the browser and requested that the container be widened to match the homepage width because the service cards looked squeezed.

Outcome:

- widened the Services editorial wrapper to `min(100%, 1500px)`, matching the homepage hero wrapper;
- bumped the WordPress child theme version to `1.5.10` for CSS cache-busting;

Outcome:

- reduced required audit-form fields to the real minimum: website URL, name, work email, and consent;
- restored `Required` / `Optional` badges beside field labels;
- restored small `i` hover/focus tooltips using the existing `.ay-info` / `.ay-tooltip` CSS system;
- restored visible helper text for fields and sections;

- changed optional readiness selects to start from neutral values like `Not sure`;
- bumped the WordPress child theme version to `1.5.12` for CSS cache-busting;
- deployed updated `functions.php` and `style.css` to the VPS and cleared WordPress/cache-enabler cache.

- checkbox controls render at 18x18px;
- tooltip visibility verified on hover;
- desktop/mobile Playwright checks: no horizontal overflow and no console errors;
- screenshot evidence:
  - `output/evidence/audit-form-ux-restore/audit-form-desktop.png`
  - `output/evidence/audit-form-ux-restore/audit-form-mobile.png`

## 2026-06-09 — About hero, sticky header, and Base2026 navigation

- changed result metadata to show one creator line plus a cleaner TikTok platform badge;
- added `avatar_url` / `creator_display_name` support to the public export and result-card UI, with fallback initials when current source data has no real avatar URL;
- verified TikTok profile oEmbed does not provide avatar URLs, and `yt-dlp` profile metadata provides video thumbnails rather than reliable creator avatars.

## 2026-06-09 — Queued result-card attribution polish

User requested a follow-up UI task for search result cards:

- align creator avatar, creator handle/date, and TikTok logo in one clean line;
- remove the oval/pill wrapper around the TikTok logo;
- make the result card/excerpt block feel more polished and production-ready while staying readable.

Status: queued in `NEXT_ACTION.md` parallel backlog. Not implemented in this pass.

## 2026-06-09 — ay23 Source page explainers and TikTok automation truth

User requested:

- make static source pages less confusing;
- highlight the full-transcript publication boundary note;
- explain `Public Evidence Excerpt`, `Related Passages`, and `Public Insight Cards`;
- investigate why a sample source page has no public insight cards;
- explain whether new TikToks are currently added automatically.

Outcome:

- deployed `base2026-source-page-explainers-ay23-20260609`;
- added accessible info hints and a highlighted policy note to generated source pages;
- changed related passage copy to explain that public snippets can be shortened;
- changed empty insight-card copy to explain that no reviewed card is linked yet;
- verified the sample source has 1 related passage and 0 insight cards in data;

## 2026-06-09 — Pipeline inventory and insight-card gap diagnosis

User asked why public insight cards are empty and requested a full MD inventory of the Base2026 pipeline for GPT Pro review.

Outcome:

- created `docs/project-memory/BASE2026_PIPELINE_INVENTORY_2026_06_09.md`;
- verified that empty cards are not a source-page rendering bug;
- diagnosed a real claim-extraction/backfill gap: public pages can have passages while no `claims` / `claim_evidence` rows exist for that source;
- counted 170 sources with passages but no insight cards as the immediate backfill target;
- documented the target local-worker pipeline: inventory, captions/ASR, faithful cleanup, claim extraction, evidence matching, public export, Meili reindex, deploy gate.

Key finding:

- Insight cards are generated from SQLite `claims` + `claim_evidence`, not directly from passages. If claim extraction did not run for a transcript, the source page will have no cards even when a useful passage exists.

## 2026-06-09 — Controller, model routing, and private insight-card backfill queue

## 2026-06-10 — MacBook Git branch and publication-staging validation

User asked whether migrated skills were available, whether Codex needed a restart, and what to do about the dirty Git state after migrating from Windows to MacBook.

Outcome:

- confirmed `~/.codex/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`, and `~/.codex/memory/global-hot-cache.md` are present and visible in the current Codex session;
- confirmed no Codex restart is needed for the currently listed skills;
- renamed the local branch from `codex/knowledge-ui-shell` to `codex/github-publication-staging`;
- installed stable PowerShell via Homebrew formula `powershell` 7.6.2;
- verified Meilisearch was already installed earlier in the MacBook activation pass;
- patched `scripts/stage-public-files.ps1` and `scripts/preflight-github-launch.ps1` so MacBook runs can use `python3`, POSIX-safe paths, and `pwsh`;
- added the 10 public-safe files discovered by dry-run audit to the staging allowlist;
- updated publication boundary docs to explicitly allow `config/creator-profiles.json`;
- corrected `docs/project-memory/DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md` so the latest deployed release is ay23, not ay16.

Verification:

- `python3 scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py` passed with `changed_files=3168`, `public_safe_candidates=3168`, `needs_review=0`, `forbidden=0`, `secret_findings=0`;
- `python3 scripts/validate-github-metadata.py` passed;
- `pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./scripts/preflight-github-launch.ps1 -SkipRemoteCheck -SkipExportPolicy -SkipLiveCheck` passed;
- `pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./scripts/stage-public-files.ps1 -SkipPreflight -SkipLicenseCheck -SkipRemoteCheck` passed with `stage_path_count=57`;
- `git diff --cached --name-only` was empty after the dry-run.

Pipeline clarification:

- project files already document the intended local-first pipeline: inventory/dedupe, caption metadata extraction, ASR fallback, faithful cleanup, claim/insight extraction, evidence verification, public export, Meilisearch reindex, package/deploy gate;
- current automation is not a finished pipeline yet: the Windows Hermes task was check-only and did not import, polish, extract claims, package, or deploy;
- next pipeline engineering work is separate from GitHub publication staging and should begin with local LLM endpoint approval plus a private 10-source claim extraction sample.

## 2026-06-10 — Local worker environment and private insight-card backfill pilot

User clarified that the Windows PC had a planned but unfinished pipeline, and that the MacBook migration is meant to continue building a production-ready local-first automation system rather than rushing GitHub publication.

Files created:

- `requirements-local-worker.txt`
- `scripts/base2026-import-claim-candidates.py`

Files updated:

- `scripts/base2026-worker.py`
- `scripts/base2026-controller.py`
- `scripts/base2026-evidence-verify.py`
- `scripts/export-public-tiktok.py`
- `scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py`
- `scripts/preflight-github-launch.ps1`
- `scripts/stage-public-files.ps1`
- project memory/publication docs

Environment changes:

- created `.venv`;
- installed `faster-whisper`, `ctranslate2`, and `requests` into `.venv`;
- started Ollama via Homebrew service;
- pulled `qwen3:8b`;
- existing Ollama models also present: `qwen3.5:9b`, `gemma3:4b`, `llava:latest`.

Pipeline fixes:

- `base2026-worker.py doctor` is now Mac-aware and reports current Python executable, required tools, ASR modules, optional tools, and local LLM env;
- controller now supports `--model` for claim extraction;
- controller run IDs now include microseconds to avoid run-folder collisions;
- controller JSON parsing is more robust;
- evidence verifier can write verified JSONL output;
- verified claim candidates can now be imported to SQLite as private/pending `insight_card_candidate` claims;
- export excludes `insight_card_candidate` from auto-promotion even when `--auto-promote-insights` is enabled.

Commands run:

- `.venv/bin/python scripts/base2026-worker.py doctor`
- `.venv/bin/python scripts/base2026-controller.py build-backfill-queue --write`
- `.venv/bin/python scripts/base2026-controller.py run-claim-extract-sample --queue .planning/backfill-insight-cards-20260610.jsonl --limit 3 --execute --model qwen3:8b`

- `.venv/bin/python scripts/check-public-export-policy.py public-data/tiktok`

Results:

- `qwen3:8b`: 3 sources, 11 candidates, 9 verified, 9 imported private/pending, average 39.007 seconds/source;
- `gemma3:4b`: 1 source, 1 candidate, 1 exact verified, 1 imported private/pending, average 9.720 seconds/source;
- local SQLite now has 10 `claim-backfill-*` pending claims and 10 matching evidence rows;
- local public export now has 1548 insight cards, 1097 public insight cards, 1449 topics, 1040 public topics;
- backfill queue decreased from 170 to 166 sources;
- public policy check passed;
- new backfill cards are not public.

## 2026-06-10 — Gemma 4 install and same-queue model routing test

User asked to install `gemma4:12b`, test it for the unfinished insight-card backfill, and keep it as the main model only if it actually works for this project.

Environment changes:

- upgraded Ollama to 0.30.7 earlier, then pulled `gemma4:12b`;
- Homebrew formula `ollama` 0.30.7 could list models but failed inference because the bottle lacked `llama-server`;
- installed `ollama-app` cask 0.30.7;
- removed the broken Homebrew formula so the cask owns `/opt/homebrew/bin/ollama`;
- copied `/Applications/Ollama.app/Contents/Resources/` to `/Users/alexyarosh/.local/ollama-app-resources/` because the app bundle kept `com.apple.quarantine` xattrs that could not be removed without elevated macOS permissions;
- started the working server with `/Users/alexyarosh/.local/ollama-app-resources/ollama serve`; after the benchmark, moved it into detached `screen` session `base2026-ollama`.

Commands run:

- `ollama pull gemma4:12b`
- `brew reinstall ollama`
- `brew install --cask ollama --force`
- `brew services stop ollama`
- `brew uninstall --formula ollama`
- `brew reinstall --cask ollama --force`
- `rsync -a --delete /Applications/Ollama.app/Contents/Resources/ /Users/alexyarosh/.local/ollama-app-resources/`
- `/Users/alexyarosh/.local/ollama-app-resources/ollama serve`
- direct `/api/generate` Gemma 4 JSON smoke test
- `.venv/bin/python scripts/base2026-claim-extract-local.py --queue .planning/backfill-insight-cards-20260610.jsonl --limit 3 --execute --model gemma4:12b --out .planning/claim-candidates-20260610-gemma4-12b.jsonl --report .planning/claim-candidates-20260610-gemma4-12b.report.md`

Results on the same current first 3 queue rows:

- `gemma4:12b`: 3 sources, 1 candidate, 1 verified, 49.870 seconds/source, 0 errors;
- `qwen3:8b`: 3 sources, 5 candidates, 5 verified, 33.972 seconds/source, 0 errors.

Decision:

- do not set `gemma4:12b` as primary claim extractor yet;
- keep `qwen3:8b` as primary extractor for the next controlled private batch;
- test `gemma4:12b` as a semantic-review/precision gate before importing a broader batch;
- no deployment, git staging, commit, push, or public promotion was performed.

## 2026-06-10 — ChatGPT Pro manual review lane for insight-card quality

User challenged whether `qwen3:8b` quality is actually good enough for public-facing card text, and suggested using ChatGPT Pro/GPT-5.4 through the browser for small batches because quality matters more than throughput.

Engineering response:

- agreed that deterministic evidence matching proves only substring presence, not semantic entailment or good writing;
- kept `qwen3:8b` as a candidate generator, not a trusted final writer;
- did not make browser ChatGPT a production worker or limit-bypass architecture;
- added a manual GPT review lane that works from generated packets and returns strict JSON for local validation.

- `docs/project-memory/NEXT_ACTION.md`
- `docs/project-memory/PIPELINE_STATUS.md`
- `docs/project-memory/STATUS_BOARD.csv`

Pipeline behavior added:

- `build-chatgpt-review-packet` creates bounded Markdown/JSON packets from public passages and private pending candidates;
- manual ChatGPT review can approve, rewrite, reject, mark needs_human, or add at most one supported missed claim per source;
- `apply-chatgpt-review` converts only approve/rewrite/new_candidate decisions back to private candidate JSONL;
- deterministic evidence verification must run again after review and before import;
- reviewed candidates remain private/pending and cannot publish directly.

Results:

- generated `.planning/chatgpt-review-packet-20260610-current-qwen3-8b.json`;
- packet contains 3 sources, 5 candidates, and 5 public passages;
- apply script accepted a matching empty synthetic review and wrote 0 rows to `/tmp`, proving the response path starts correctly;
- apply script accepted one synthetic approval for a real packet candidate and wrote 1 row to `/tmp` with evidence present;
- one Qwen candidate visibly mismatches semantics: claim about longer AI queries used evidence about fewer clicks/relying on impressions, proving exact evidence matching alone is insufficient;
- `git diff --check` passed after removing one trailing whitespace issue in `README.md`;
- publication boundary audit passed with `changed_files=3171`, `public_safe_candidates=3171`, `needs_review=0`, `forbidden=0`, `secret_findings=0`;
- GitHub metadata validation passed.

Forbidden actions still in force:

- no TikTok intake;
- no ASR batch;
- no deployment;
- no staging, commit, push, or public promotion;
- no raw captions, full private transcripts, DB files, media, logs, cookies, tokens, or credentials in ChatGPT packets.

## 2026-06-10 — GPT/Codex becomes primary small-batch card quality lane

User clarified that Base2026 has low expected volume now, a ChatGPT Pro subscription is available, and public-facing card text quality matters more than forcing Qwen/Gemma into the center of the workflow.

Engineering response:

- agreed that GPT-5.4 high/Codex is the right primary lane for small-batch claim extraction and semantic/copy review;
- moved `qwen3:8b` to optional local draft/prefilter/offline mode;
- kept deterministic scripts as the durable pipeline: queue -> packet -> strict JSON -> apply -> evidence verify -> private import;
- kept Hermes as a local operator that may orchestrate scripts, not a production dependency or hidden browser worker.

- `docs/project-memory/STATUS_BOARD.csv`

Pipeline behavior added:

- `scripts/base2026-build-chatgpt-review-packet.py` now supports `--mode extract` with no local candidate file;
- source-only packets ask GPT/Codex to return `new_candidate` decisions from public passages;
- review packets with Qwen candidates still work for optional local draft review;
- `scripts/base2026-apply-chatgpt-review.py` already accepts `new_candidate` decisions and re-checks exact/normalized evidence presence against the packet passages.

- packet contains 3 sources, 0 local candidates, and 5 public passages;
- synthetic source-only `new_candidate` apply test wrote 1 private candidate row to `/tmp`;
- deterministic evidence verification over that row passed with 1 exact match and 1 verified candidate.
- Codex processed the real 3-source source-only packet and wrote `.planning/chatgpt-extract-response-20260610-source-only.codex.json`;
- apply step wrote 8 private candidate rows;
- evidence verification passed with 8 exact matches, 8 verified, 0 rejected;
- dry-run import selected 8, with 0 duplicates and 0 missing videos;
- apply import inserted 8 claims and 8 evidence rows as `review_status = pending`;

## 2026-06-10 — Controlled 10-source GPT/Codex source-only batch

User pushed to move faster on the working pipeline. Continued the GPT/Codex source-only path with guardrails instead of running unbounded extraction.

Guardrails added:

- `apply-chatgpt-review` now enforces minimum `quality_score` default 4;
- maximum 3 new candidates per source;
- maximum claim/action/evidence length limits;
- stats now report low-quality, too-long, and too-many-new-candidate skips;

Next engineering stop:

- do not keep importing batches blindly;
- add promotion review/report for the 38 private/pending candidates before any public promotion.

## 2026-06-10 — Full insight-card backfill, release package, deploy blocker

User requested all current videos/cards processed and deployed.

Actions taken:

- Promoted previously reviewed safe pending candidates.
- Ran GPT/Codex source-only extraction batches `01` through `09` over all sources with public passages and no insight cards.
- Applied guardrails, deterministic evidence verification, import, review, and explicit promotion after each batch.
- Added `scripts/base2026-promote-insight-candidates.py` and controller integration for explicit reviewed promotion.
- Added reviewed-no-card support to `scripts/base2026-build-backfill-queue.py` so sources reviewed by GPT/Codex but lacking a promotion-safe card do not stay in an infinite queue.
- Created ignored local registry `.planning/reviewed-no-card-sources.jsonl` for 45 reviewed-no-card sources.
- Fixed MacBook compatibility in release scripts: `pwsh`, POSIX paths, Python 3.9-safe text writes, and default VPS host `root@207.244.242.42`.

- public export policy: `ok=true`, full transcripts excluded;
- GitHub metadata validation: ok;
- preflight with live remote checks skipped passed.

Deploy blocker:

- Deploy did not complete because this MacBook does not have an SSH private key accepted by `root@207.244.242.42`.
- Tried `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, `~/.ssh/hiddify_key`, and `~/.ssh/github_actions_dtb`; all returned `Permission denied (publickey,password)`.
- Host key was added for `207.244.242.42`; the blocker is authentication, not DNS or packaging.
- Next safe action after restoring server SSH access: `pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./scripts/deploy-public-vps.ps1 -ReleaseName base2026-full-cards-ay24-20260610`.

Update:

- User provided the migrated deploy key paths: `~/.ssh/geo_contabo_ed25519`, `~/.ssh/geo_contabo_ed25519.pub`, and `~/.ssh/config`.
- SSH aliases `geo` / `geo-contabo` work against `root@207.244.242.42`.
- Ran `pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./scripts/deploy-public-vps.ps1 -ReleaseName base2026-full-cards-ay24-20260610 -SshHost geo`.
- Deploy succeeded: nginx config tested, current symlink switched to `/var/www/base2026-knowledge/releases/base2026-full-cards-ay24-20260610`, and Meilisearch reindexed 1392 chunks.
- Server manifest confirms 957 source records, 1392 passages, 1690 insight cards, 1226 public insight cards, and 1584 topics.
- Live search smoke for `AI Overviews` returned 926 estimated hits.

## 2026-06-10 — Command-center queue and PIPE-01.1 controller entrypoints

User corrected the workflow: new site and pipeline tasks must be captured in a real queue, delegated when useful, and then verified by Codex instead of being lost in chat.

Files updated:

- `docs/project-memory/ACTIVE_QUEUE.md`
- `docs/project-memory/NEXT_ACTION.md`
- `docs/project-memory/PIPELINE_STATUS.md`
- `scripts/base2026-controller.py`

Actions taken:

- Created/updated the command-center queue with `GEO-01`, `GEO-02`, `PIPE-01`, `GIT-01`, and `PUB-01`.
- Integrated worker findings for pipeline, git hygiene, and publication gates.
- Closed completed explorer workers after their results were folded into the queue.
- Added controller command `tiktok-metadata-extract` as the tracked wrapper around `scripts/tiktok-ytdlp-metadata-extract.py`.
- Added controller command `import-tiktok-staging` as the tracked wrapper around `scripts/import-tiktok-staging-to-kb.py`.
- Kept `import-tiktok-staging` dry-run by default; SQLite writes require explicit `--apply`.
- Extended `doctor` to check the TikTok metadata extractor, browser caption extractor, and staging importer.

Commands run:

- `.venv/bin/python -m py_compile scripts/base2026-controller.py`
- `.venv/bin/python scripts/base2026-controller.py doctor`
- `.venv/bin/python scripts/base2026-controller.py list-runs --limit 5`
- `.venv/bin/python scripts/base2026-controller.py tiktok-metadata-extract --help`
- `.venv/bin/python scripts/base2026-controller.py import-tiktok-staging --help`

Results:

- controller compile passed;
- `doctor` passed and now includes TikTok intake script checks;
- run listing works;
- new controller commands are available;
- no TikTok intake, ASR batch, staging, commit, push, or deploy was run.

Next:

- Continue `PIPE-01.2`: replace hardcoded TikTok creator inventory with config-driven public-safe examples while keeping real intake queues private/uncommitted.

## 2026-06-10 — PIPE-01.2 config-driven TikTok creator inventory

Continued the new-source pipeline hardening after controller entrypoints.

Files updated:

- `scripts/tiktok-backfill-inventory.ps1`
- `scripts/hermes-tiktok-refresh.ps1`
- `docs/project-memory/ACTIVE_QUEUE.md`
- `docs/project-memory/NEXT_ACTION.md`
- `docs/project-memory/PIPELINE_STATUS.md`
- `docs/project-memory/PROMPT_LOG.md`

Behavior added:

- removed the hardcoded TikTok creator list from `scripts/tiktok-backfill-inventory.ps1`;
- added `-CreatorsConfig`;
- added default creator config resolution order:
  - `config/tiktok-intake-queue.local.json`;
  - `config/tiktok-intake-queue.20260608.json`;
  - `config/creators.example.json`;
- supported both public example array config and private intake queue config with a `creators` array;
- added `-ResolveCreatorsOnly` to validate config parsing without network access, CSV writes, or TikTok intake;
- passed `-CreatorsConfig` through from `scripts/hermes-tiktok-refresh.ps1` to inventory.

Commands run:

- `pwsh -NoProfile -Command '[System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseFile(...)'` for `scripts/tiktok-backfill-inventory.ps1`
- `pwsh -NoProfile -Command '[System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseFile(...)'` for `scripts/hermes-tiktok-refresh.ps1`
- `pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./scripts/tiktok-backfill-inventory.ps1 -CreatorsConfig config/creators.example.json -ResolveCreatorsOnly`
- `pwsh -NoProfile -Command './scripts/tiktok-backfill-inventory.ps1 -ResolveCreatorsOnly | ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object config,count | ConvertTo-Json -Compress'`
- `git diff --check -- scripts/base2026-controller.py scripts/tiktok-backfill-inventory.ps1 scripts/hermes-tiktok-refresh.ps1 docs/project-memory/ACTIVE_QUEUE.md docs/project-memory/NEXT_ACTION.md docs/project-memory/PIPELINE_STATUS.md docs/project-memory/PROMPT_LOG.md`
- `.venv/bin/python -m py_compile scripts/base2026-controller.py`
- `.venv/bin/python scripts/base2026-controller.py doctor`

Results:

- PowerShell syntax checks passed;
- public example config resolves to one enabled TikTok creator;
- default private config resolves without dumping private rows;
- targeted `git diff --check` passed;
- controller compile and doctor passed;
- no `yt-dlp`, TikTok intake, ASR batch, staging, commit, push, or deploy was run.

Next:

- Continue `PIPE-01.3`: unify staging schema across yt-dlp metadata, browser caption extraction, and SQLite import.

## 2026-06-10 — PIPE-01.3 TikTok staging schema normalization

Continued pipeline hardening after config-driven creator inventory.

Files updated:

- `scripts/tiktok-ytdlp-metadata-extract.py`
- `scripts/tiktok-caption-browser-extract.mjs`
- `scripts/import-tiktok-staging-to-kb.py`
- `docs/schemas/TIKTOK_INTAKE_RECORD_SCHEMA.md`
- `docs/project-memory/ACTIVE_QUEUE.md`
- `docs/project-memory/NEXT_ACTION.md`
- `docs/project-memory/PIPELINE_STATUS.md`
- `docs/project-memory/PROMPT_LOG.md`

Behavior added:

- yt-dlp extractor now emits `canonical_url`;
- browser caption extractor now emits `webpage_url` and `extractor`;
- staging importer normalizes URL aliases in this priority order: `canonical_url`, `webpage_url`, `source_url`;
- staging importer normalizes `creator_handle`, `creator_url`, `source_id`, `transcript_text`, and `quality_flags`;
- schema doc now describes URL alias and import normalization rules.

Commands run:

- `.venv/bin/python -m py_compile scripts/tiktok-ytdlp-metadata-extract.py scripts/import-tiktok-staging-to-kb.py scripts/base2026-controller.py`
- `node --check scripts/tiktok-caption-browser-extract.mjs`
- `.venv/bin/python scripts/base2026-controller.py doctor`
- `.venv/bin/python scripts/base2026-controller.py import-tiktok-staging`
- `git diff --check -- scripts/tiktok-ytdlp-metadata-extract.py scripts/tiktok-caption-browser-extract.mjs scripts/import-tiktok-staging-to-kb.py docs/schemas/TIKTOK_INTAKE_RECORD_SCHEMA.md`

Results:

- Python compile passed;
- Node syntax check passed;
- controller doctor passed;
- import dry-run over `.planning/tiktok-ytdlp-20260608.jsonl` selected 26 rows and skipped 42;
- no SQLite writes, TikTok intake, ASR batch, staging, commit, push, or deploy was run.

Next:

- Continue `PIPE-01.4`: smoke-test one existing local audio sample through the `faster-whisper` worker path; do not run broad ASR.

## 2026-06-10 — PIPE-01.4 one-file faster-whisper ASR smoke

Continued pipeline hardening after staging schema normalization.

Files updated:

- `scripts/base2026-worker.py`
- `docs/project-memory/ACTIVE_QUEUE.md`
- `docs/project-memory/NEXT_ACTION.md`
- `docs/project-memory/PIPELINE_STATUS.md`
- `docs/project-memory/PROMPT_LOG.md`

Behavior added:

- `scripts/base2026-worker.py transcribe` now retries the same file without VAD when `--vad-filter` produces empty text;
- ASR metadata records `vad_filter` and `retry_without_vad`;
- this prevents a false-success empty transcript path in future batches.

Commands run:

- `find ... audio-fallback ... | ffprobe ... | sort -n | head -10`
- `.venv/bin/python scripts/base2026-worker.py doctor`
- `.venv/bin/python scripts/base2026-worker.py transcribe 12_knowledge-base/sources/tiktok/transcripts/audio-fallback/7576358465585630486.mp3 --model tiny.en --device cpu --compute-type int8 --vad-filter`

- `.venv/bin/python scripts/base2026-worker.py clean .planning/local-worker-poc/transcripts/7576358465585630486.raw.txt`
- `git diff --check -- scripts/base2026-worker.py docs/project-memory/ACTIVE_QUEUE.md docs/project-memory/NEXT_ACTION.md docs/project-memory/PIPELINE_STATUS.md docs/project-memory/PROMPT_LOG.md`

Results:

- local worker doctor passed with `ffmpeg`, `yt-dlp`, `faster_whisper`, `ctranslate2`, and `requests` available;
- shortest local sample found: 6.15 seconds;
- first VAD smoke returned `segment_count=0`, `word_count=0`;
- non-VAD run returned `segment_count=1`, `word_count=10`;
- worker retry fix then made the `--vad-filter` command return `segment_count=1`, `word_count=10`, `retry_without_vad=true`;
- deterministic cleanup guard passed with 10 raw words and 10 clean words;
- no broad ASR batch, TikTok intake, SQLite import apply, staging, commit, push, or deploy was run.

Next:

- Continue `PIPE-01.5`: make new-source import resumable and dry-run first before any SQLite writes.

## 2026-06-10 — PIPE-01.5 dry-run-first resumable TikTok staging import

Continued pipeline hardening after ASR smoke.

Files updated:

- `scripts/import-tiktok-staging-to-kb.py`
- `scripts/base2026-controller.py`
- `docs/project-memory/ACTIVE_QUEUE.md`
- `docs/project-memory/NEXT_ACTION.md`
- `docs/project-memory/PIPELINE_STATUS.md`
- `docs/project-memory/PROMPT_LOG.md`

Behavior added:

- importer dry-run now reports total rows, selected/skipped rows, existing/new rows, and skip reasons;
- importer supports `--limit`, `--source-id`, and `--report`;
- controller `import-tiktok-staging` forwards `--limit`, `--source-id`, and `--report`;
- current staging file can be checked for resumability before any SQLite writes.

Commands run:

- `.venv/bin/python -m py_compile scripts/import-tiktok-staging-to-kb.py scripts/base2026-controller.py`
- `.venv/bin/python scripts/base2026-controller.py import-tiktok-staging --help`

- `.venv/bin/python scripts/base2026-controller.py doctor`
- `.venv/bin/python scripts/base2026-controller.py list-runs --limit 8`

Results:

- compile passed;
- controller help shows new import controls;
- dry-run report created under ignored `.planning/`;
- current staging file: 68 rows, 26 selected, 42 skipped, 26 existing, 0 new;
- skip reasons: 37 `not_caption_ready`, 5 `blocked_quality_flag`;
- reviewer pass updated publication allowlist/staging allowlist for public-safe pipeline scripts `scripts/hermes-tiktok-refresh.ps1` and `scripts/tiktok-backfill-inventory.ps1`;
- publication boundary audit passed after the update: 3176 changed files, 3176 public-safe candidates, 0 needs review, 0 forbidden, 0 secret findings;
- GitHub metadata validation passed;
- no SQLite writes, TikTok intake, broad ASR, staging, commit, push, or deploy was run.

Next:

- Continue `PIPE-01.6`: wire source-backed card extraction for newly imported sources, gated by deterministic evidence verification and manual review.

## 2026-06-10 — Stage, deploy, publish checkpoint

User clarified that local-only work is not enough and asked to stage/deploy/publish visible work.

Actions taken:

- ran publication boundary audit;
- ran GitHub metadata validation;
- ran preflight with remote check skipped;
- deployed release `base2026-stage-ay25-20260610` through `scripts/deploy-public-vps.ps1 -SshHost geo`;
- reindexed Meilisearch on the VPS;
- verified live URLs and public data contract;
- staged public-safe repository files through `scripts/stage-public-files.ps1 -Apply -SkipRemoteCheck`.

Verification:

- boundary audit: 3176 changed files, 3176 public-safe candidates, 0 needs review, 0 forbidden, 0 secret findings;
- preflight: ok;
- deployed path: `/var/www/base2026-knowledge/releases/base2026-stage-ay25-20260610`;
- public export policy: 957 source records, 1392 passages, 1690 insight cards, 1226 public insight cards;

- browser checks passed for desktop/mobile overflow on Base2026 and WordPress home/about;
- public-safe git staging completed with 3176 staged files.

Remaining publication blocker:

- GitHub remote is not configured, so GitHub push/public repo publication still needs a repo target before push.

## 2026-06-10 — Mixed mobile visual QA automation and deploy

User asked to architect, automate, test, fix, deploy, and verify the mobile visual QA workflow for the mixed WordPress + Base2026 public site.

Actions taken:

- added `scripts/mobile-visual-qa.mjs`, a Playwright-based live QA runner for WordPress root pages and Base2026 `/knowledge/` pages;
- added `docs/project-memory/MOBILE_VISUAL_QA_RUNBOOK.md`;
- ran an initial full live matrix: 66 checks, 7 failures;

- server current symlink points to `/var/www/base2026-knowledge/releases/base2026-mobile-visual-qa-ay25-20260610`;
- final live matrix: 66 route/viewport checks, 0 failures, 0 warnings;
- evidence written under ignored `output/evidence/mobile-visual-qa-live-20260610-final/`;
- no TikTok intake, SQLite writes, Git commit, Git push, or GitHub publication was run.

## 2026-06-10 — Desktop Base2026 UI polish and deploy

User reviewed live Base2026 desktop pages and asked to fix source-record modal scrolling, cramped creator/source cards, oversized typography, roadmap density, and support page structure.

Actions taken:

- reduced global Base2026 desktop type scale and generated public-page cache-bust;
- replaced the large roadmap SVG flow with compact phase tabs and phase sequence cards;

- evidence is under ignored `output/evidence/desktop-ui-live-20260610/`;
- no Git commit, Git push, GitHub publication, TikTok intake, or SQLite write was run.

## 2026-06-10 — Desktop typography correction after live review

User reported that the live Roadmap and Support pages still looked unchanged: flow did not feel fixed and headings were still too large.

Actions taken:

- confirmed live ay26 had deployed, but the typography reduction was too weak;
- made a stronger desktop density correction in `web/static/styles.css`;
- bumped generated cache-bust to `20260610-desktopqa2`;
- packaged and deployed `base2026-desktop-ui-ay27-20260610`;

## 2026-06-10 — Source/topic IA cleanup after live review

User reviewed live topic/source/search pages and reported double `@@` handles, unclear evidence passage structure, oversized source metadata/topic chips, hard-to-read source excerpt copy, missing share/save affordances, too-large selected-term close controls, and visible text `tiktok` where TikTok should be represented by logo.

Actions taken:

- normalized generated creator handles to a single visible `@`;
- added compact share/copy/citation/print controls to generated creator/topic/source pages using inline neutral SVG controls;
- replaced source-page metric/topic sections with a compact source metadata strip;
- changed generated source metadata and Meili search badges/modal platform values to icon-only TikTok presentation;
- renamed `Public Evidence Excerpt` to `Source Excerpt`;
- paragraphized source excerpts and passage previews;
- rebuilt topic evidence passages as source-linked cards with creator/date context;
- reduced selected search term close control styling;
- bumped Base2026 cache-bust to `20260610-sourceia1`;
- packaged and deployed `base2026-source-topic-ia-ay28-20260610`;

- live checks confirmed no `@@`, no old `Public Evidence Excerpt` label, share controls present, compact source metadata, icon-only TikTok metadata, selected close control at 14px/10px, and no horizontal overflow;
- evidence written under ignored `output/evidence/source-topic-ia-ay28-live-*.png`;
- no Git commit, Git push, GitHub publication, TikTok intake, or SQLite write was run.

## 2026-06-10 — ay29c UI hotfix after live review

User reported that the generated share bar had an unwanted decorative AI-style sparkle, TikTok source icons were sitting below the creator/date row, and the `/knowledge/` independent-pilot copy/heading felt oversized and weak.

Actions taken:

- removed the sparkle mark from generated share bars;
- moved TikTok platform marks into the creator/date row on search cards;
- verified source modal attribution also keeps the TikTok mark in the creator/date row;
- fixed source-record modal loading by streaming `documents.jsonl` until the requested `item_id` is found;
- rewrote the `/knowledge/` project identity block, linked `Alex Yarosh` to `/about/`, and reduced the project identity H2;
- changed the modal label from `Public evidence excerpt` to `Source excerpt`;
- bumped Base2026 cache-bust to `20260610-ay29c`;
- packaged and deployed `base2026-ui-hotfix-ay29c-20260610`;
- reindexed Meilisearch with 1392 passages.

Verification:

- live `/knowledge/` loads CSS/JS cache-bust `20260610-ay29c`;
- old project-identity copy is absent and the `Alex Yarosh` link is present;
- topic share label has no decorative sparkle SVG/path;
- search result TikTok badge and source-modal TikTok mark align with creator/date;
- source modal opens successfully and uses `Source excerpt`;
- checked pages have no horizontal overflow;
- evidence written to ignored `output/evidence/ui-hotfix-ay29c-live-modal.png` and `output/evidence/ui-hotfix-ay29c-live-topic.png`;
- no Git commit, Git push, GitHub publication, TikTok intake, or SQLite write was run.

## 2026-06-10 — Launch commit and MacBook check-only automation

User explicitly requested deployment/launch activation instead of further visual iteration.

Actions taken:

- committed the public-safe staged launch state as `d025d71 launch: stage Base2026 public release`;
- confirmed no Git remote is configured, so GitHub push is blocked until the exact `origin` URL is provided;
- ran controller `doctor`, `inventory-check`, `data-quality-report`, `daily-digest`, and public export policy checks;
- confirmed the 32 `promotion_candidate` insight-card candidates from the earlier report are already `approved`;
- reviewed the remaining 2 pending insight-card candidates, rejected the missing-evidence candidate, and parked the generic `needs_human` candidate outside public export;
- fixed `scripts/hermes-tiktok-refresh.ps1` for macOS PowerShell by passing named parameters to `tiktok-backfill-inventory.ps1`;
- installed and loaded the Mac launchd check-only job `com.base2026.hermes-tiktok-check` for 03:30 and 15:30 local time;
- ran a launchd smoke test with exit code 0.

Verification:

- live site remains `base2026-ui-hotfix-ay29c-20260610`;
- public export policy: 957 source records, 1392 passages, 1690 insight cards, 1226 public insight cards, 1159 public topics, `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- pending insight-card candidates: 0;
- Mac launchd check-only run: 2419 total TikTok rows, 999 active, 57 queued transcripts, 0 `needs_asr`, 940 transcribed, 0 `needs_polish`;
- no raw/private data was staged or pushed;
- no GitHub push was run because no remote is configured.

## 2026-06-10 — Public GitHub publication

User requested final GitHub publication for Base2026 after launch QA and public/private boundary checks.

Actions taken:

- confirmed `geo` launch analytics were deployed and pushed separately;
- ran Base2026 publication boundary audit, GitHub metadata validation, and preflight before publication;
- created public repository `https://github.com/offflinerpsy/base2026`;
- pushed audited Base2026 source to `main`;
- set GitHub default branch to `main`;
- also pushed `codex/github-publication-staging` as the original publication staging branch;
- updated project memory so future agents do not treat GitHub remote selection as blocked.

Verification:

- `python3 scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py`: `forbidden=0`, `secret_findings=0`;
- `python3 scripts/validate-github-metadata.py`: `github-metadata=ok`;
- `pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./scripts/preflight-github-launch.ps1 -SkipRemoteCheck -SkipExportPolicy -SkipLiveCheck`: `preflight=ok`;
- GitHub reports `offflinerpsy/base2026` as `PUBLIC` with default branch `main`.

## 2026-06-10 — Source modal metadata moved to sticky header

User selected the source modal `Public policy / Platform / Language` block and asked to move it into the non-scrolling top header near the controls.

Actions taken:

- added `#transcript-header-meta` to the source modal sticky header;
- moved policy/platform/language rendering from `#transcript-body` into the sticky header;
- shortened header labels to `Policy`, `Platform`, and `Lang`;

## 2026-06-10 — Base2026 sitemap accepted by GSC

User wanted the launch/indexing work finished rather than leaving the Base2026 sitemap in Search Console as a `Couldn't fetch` open loop.

Actions taken:

- confirmed Search Console still showed `/knowledge/sitemap.xml` as `Couldn't fetch`;
- changed `scripts/generate-base2026-sitemap.py` to generate a sitemap index plus child sitemaps;
- packaged and deployed `base2026-sitemap-index-ay31-20260610`;
- verified live XML as Googlebot: sitemap index with three child files and 1080 total URLs;
- updated the `geo` live indexing/schema QA script to recursively read sitemap indexes;
- resubmitted `/knowledge/sitemap.xml` in Search Console through the authenticated Chrome session.

Verification:

- GSC status: `Success`;
- GSC type: `Sitemap`;
- GSC last read: `2026-06-10`;
- GSC discovered pages: `1,080`;
- live indexing/schema QA: 104 checks, 0 failures;
- publication boundary audit after code change: `forbidden=0`, `secret_findings=0`.

## 2026-06-10 — Priority URL inspection after sitemap acceptance

Actions taken:

- inspected priority URLs in Google Search Console after the Base2026 sitemap started showing `Success`;
- confirmed `https://aggressorbulkit.online/` is already on Google and indexed;
- confirmed `https://aggressorbulkit.online/knowledge/` is already on Google and indexed;
- requested indexing for `https://aggressorbulkit.online/services/`.

Verification:

- `/services/`: GSC confirmed `Indexing requested` and added the URL to a priority crawl queue;
- `/pricing/`, `/about/`, and `/ai-visibility-audit/`: GSC showed `URL is not on Google`, but manual request submission hit `Quota Exceeded`;
- next GSC manual action is to request those three URLs after the daily quota resets.

## 2026-06-10 — Source modal metadata moved into control area

User selected the source modal `Public policy / Platform / Language` block again and clarified that it should sit in the fixed top control area where the action buttons are, not as a wide row that still feels like body content.

Actions taken:

- moved `#transcript-header-meta` inside `.transcript-dialog-controls`;
- added `.transcript-dialog-actions-row` so actions/close stay together and metadata sits directly below them;
- kept metadata out of `#transcript-body`;
- fixed mobile CSS specificity so the header metadata remains compact instead of becoming a tall single column;
- bumped release cache-bust to `20260610-modalmeta2`;
- packaged and deployed `base2026-modal-meta-controls-ay32-20260610` with `-SkipReindex`;
- retried GSC indexing for `/pricing/`, but the daily quota is still exceeded.

Verification:

- local release QA: `ok=true`;
- live QA: `ok=true`;
- live CSS/JS cache-bust: `20260610-modalmeta2`;
- source modal header meta parent: `.transcript-dialog-controls`;
- header meta cards: `3`;
- body policy grids: `0`;
- desktop/mobile horizontal overflow: false;
- console errors: `0`;
- evidence:
  - `output/evidence/modal-meta-controls-ay32-local/desktop.png`;
  - `output/evidence/modal-meta-controls-ay32-local/mobile.png`;
  - `output/evidence/modal-meta-controls-ay32-live/desktop.png`;
  - `output/evidence/modal-meta-controls-ay32-live/mobile.png`.

## 2026-06-10 — Source modal metadata cache refresh

User selected the live source modal metadata block again and asked to move it into the fixed top control area. Local and clean live QA already showed the ay32 structure was correct, but the user's open browser tab could still show the older asset state.

Actions taken:

- confirmed live clean-load DOM already had `#transcript-header-meta` inside `.transcript-dialog-controls`;
- synchronized `web/static/meili.html` cache-bust with the package cache-bust;
- bumped Base2026 cache-bust to `20260610-modalmeta3`;
- changed `scripts/deploy-public-vps.ps1` default SSH host to the working `geo` alias after the first upload attempt failed with the raw `root@207.244.242.42` host;
- packaged and deployed `base2026-modal-meta-cache-ay33-20260610` with `-SkipReindex`.

Verification:

- live CSS/JS cache-bust: `20260610-modalmeta3`;
- source modal header meta parent: `.transcript-dialog-controls`;
- header meta cards: `3`;
- body policy grids: `0`;
- sticky header remains stable during modal body scroll;
- desktop/mobile horizontal overflow: false;
- console errors: `0`;
- nginx verification: pass.

## 2026-06-10 — Empty source page diagnosis and targeted hydration repair

User reported that `/knowledge/sources/tiktok-video-7648365806375488782.html` was empty on live.

Actions taken:

- confirmed live page still showed the empty-source state;
- traced the cause to a `generic_items` row with no `generic_documents`/`chunks`, while the TikTok video had available `eng-US` platform subtitles;
- downloaded the platform subtitle locally, created a cleaned caption transcript, and hydrated the local SQLite KB with one document and four chunks;
- regenerated the public export with `--auto-promote-insights` so public insight cards did not collapse;
- added a source-page evidence gate in `scripts/generate-public-pages.py`: source records with no excerpt, no public passages, and no public insight cards are now `noindex,follow` and excluded from source index / creator latest-source cards;
- regenerated static pages and sitemap index/children locally.
- packaged ignored release artifact `base2026-source-hydration-ay34-20260610.zip` without deploying.

Verification:

- public export policy: `ok=true`, `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- local export: 957 source records, 1396 passages, 1690 insight cards, 1226 public insight cards, 1584 topics, 1159 public topics;
- local repaired page contains `OpenAI just announced ChatGPT sites`;
- local repaired page no longer contains `No public excerpt is available`;
- child sitemap includes `tiktok-video-7648365806375488782.html`;
- packaged release sitemap has 1078 URLs; the one-count difference from the local web root is expected because the deploy package serves `meili.html` as `/knowledge/index.html`;
- two older no-audio `@tjrobertson52` source-review pages are excluded from child sitemaps;
- publication boundary audit: `forbidden=0`, `secret_findings=0`;
- GitHub metadata validation: `ok`.

Next step:

- package and deploy the repaired Base2026 public export, then verify the live page has the excerpt and no empty-state text.

## 2026-06-10 — Source page hero metadata/share consolidation

User selected the source-page metadata strip on `/knowledge/sources/tiktok-video-7648365806375488782.html` and asked to move the wide `Published / Platform / Insights / Topics` strip upward into the source-record hero, with share controls also raised and reduced to neutral icon controls.

Actions taken:

- added source-page-specific compact share controls in `scripts/generate-public-pages.py`;
- moved source metadata into `.source-hero-meta` inside `.source-page-hero`;
- removed the separate `.source-meta-strip` from generated source pages;
- kept source share actions as icon-only controls with accessible labels and orange hover/focus color;
- bumped Base2026 static cache-bust to `20260610-sourcehero1`;
- packaged and deployed `base2026-source-hero-ay35-20260610`;
- reindexed Meilisearch with 1396 passages.

Verification:

- deploy script reported `deployed=base2026-source-hero-ay35-20260610`;
- deploy script reported `indexed=1396 index=base2026_public_tiktok`;
- live source page contains `.source-page-hero`, `.source-share-actions`, and `.source-hero-meta`;
- live source page has no `.source-meta-strip`;
- live source page contains `OpenAI just announced ChatGPT sites`;
- live source page does not contain `No public excerpt is available`;
- live desktop/mobile browser QA: overflow false, console errors 0;
- evidence:
  - `output/evidence/source-hero-ay35-live/desktop.png`;
  - `output/evidence/source-hero-ay35-live/mobile.png`.

## 2026-06-10 — GitHub SEO readiness, static compression, and ay37 deploy

User asked to finish Base2026 GitHub/open-source readiness, clean up SEO/performance, deploy, and push the public-safe project state.

Actions taken:

- updated `README.md` for the public GitHub repo with live demo, current data counts, maintainer/contact, public boundary, and contribution areas;
- added generated-source Markdown pages for Base2026 Methodology and Creator Correction / Removal under `docs/public-pages/`;
- updated `scripts/generate-info-pages.py` so Methodology and opt-out/correction pages are generated consistently with the other public info pages;
- synchronized `web/static/index.html` with the current public search UI;
- added metadata/canonical/schema/noindex to the roadmap data-viz test page;
- fixed mobile source-page `Public Insight Cards` overflow by letting card grids shrink below 340px;
- bumped Base2026 static cache-bust to `20260610-ay37`;

- reindexed Meilisearch with 1396 passages.

Verification:

- public export policy: ok, `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- publication boundary audit: `forbidden=0`, `secret_findings=0`, `needs_review=0`;
- GitHub metadata validation: ok;
- local static SEO metadata audit: 3294 HTML files, 0 missing title/description/canonical/H1/schema;
- live root/methodology/opt-out/source smoke: title, description, canonical, schema, and one H1 present; old empty-source text absent;
- live CSS/JS headers: gzip plus immutable cache headers;
- full live mobile visual QA: 66 checks, 0 failures; evidence under ignored `output/evidence/mobile-visual-qa-live-ay37-20260610/`.

Next step:

- stage the public-safe allowlisted paths, commit, push `main` to GitHub, then resume GSC priority indexing and check-only TikTok pipeline work.

## 2026-06-11 — Launch contour, lead-flow recipient, and ay38 card backfill

User asked to stop reporting and close the launch contour: GSC indexing, analytics events, lead flow, card pipeline, and Base2026 launch readiness.

Actions taken:

- used the authenticated Chrome/GSC tab to inspect `/pricing/`; GSC reported `URL is not on Google` with `Discovered - currently not indexed`, then `Quota Exceeded` after requesting indexing;
- confirmed both submitted sitemaps are accepted in GSC: WordPress sitemap and Base2026 sitemap index;
- verified live consent-gated analytics: GTM `GTM-M73PZ47H`, GA4 `G-D7EF02H9D2`, and real GA4 collect hits for `page_view`, `cta_clicked`, and `form_submitted`;
- fixed WordPress lead delivery so all lead forms send to `AY_CONTACT_EMAIL` (`offflinerpsy@gmail.com`) instead of the local WordPress admin email placeholder;
- processed the final Base2026 source-with-passages/no-card queue item, created 2 source-backed candidates, promoted them to `approved`, regenerated the public export, and closed the queue to 0;
- regenerated public pages and sitemap;
- deployed `base2026-card-backfill-ay38-20260611`;
- reindexed Meilisearch with 1396 passages.

Verification:

- WordPress server PHP lint passed before replacing `functions.php`;

- public export policy: `ok=true`, `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- publication boundary audit: `forbidden=0`, `secret_findings=0`, `needs_review=0`;
- GitHub metadata validation: ok;
- live source page `/knowledge/sources/tiktok-video-7648365806375488782.html` contains `Source Excerpt`, `Public Insight Cards`, `AI knowledge base architecture`, and `AI workflow documentation`; old empty-state text is absent;
- live launch readiness QA: `siteReady=true`, `failedSteps=[]`;
- live mobile visual QA: 66 checks, 0 failures.

Next step:

- retry manual indexing for `/pricing/`, `/about/`, and `/ai-visibility-audit/` only after the GSC daily quota resets; otherwise move to check-only TikTok intake automation.

## 2026-06-11 — Mobile video UX pass and ay41 deploy

User provided a mobile walkthrough video and asked to turn it into shipped fixes, not more discussion.

Actions taken:

- transcribed/reviewed the video evidence and converted it into a mobile UX backlog;
- tightened WordPress homepage/services/pricing/about mobile density through source-controlled generator/CSS changes;
- connected the Google Calendar booking link in the About contact block and Thank You CTA;
- deployed WordPress child-theme CSS `1.5.32`, `functions.php`, and targeted page updates for `home`, `pricing`, `about`, and `thank-you-ai-visibility-audit`;
- tightened Base2026 `/knowledge/` mobile search, source modal, source page controls, share/meta controls, and roadmap mobile/fallback behavior;
- fixed `web/static/meili.html` so the live Base2026 search header CTA is `Check My AI Visibility`;
- deployed `base2026-mobile-video-ux-ay41-20260611` with `-SkipReindex` after the data-preserving CSS/template pass.

Verification:

- Base2026 publication boundary audit: `forbidden=0`, `secret_findings=0`, `needs_review=0`;
- GitHub metadata validation: ok;
- final live mixed visual QA: 66 checks, 0 failures; evidence under `output/evidence/mobile-visual-qa-live-20260611-mobilevideo-ay41/`;
- targeted live checks: Base2026 header CTA is `Check My AI Visibility`, roadmap overflow offenders are 0, `/knowledge/sources/tiktok-video-7648365806375488782.html` has source excerpt content, 4 passage cards, 2 topic chips, and no empty-source text.

Next step:

- settle GitHub staging policy for the ay41 generated public HTML before pushing; then continue GSC manual indexing after quota reset and check-only TikTok intake hardening.

## 2026-06-11 — Canonical Base2026 source identity and ay42b deploy

User pointed out that source pages, creator pages, and source modals rendered the same creator/source data with different hierarchy, repeated `source record` text, inconsistent share controls, and inconsistent TikTok/date placement.

Actions taken:

- introduced a single source/creator identity pattern in the public page generator and modal JS;
- changed source-page H1s to show the handle/title cleanly without repeating `source record`;
- moved creator/date/TikTok into the same identity row across source pages, creator pages, and modals;

- GitHub metadata validation passed;
- live targeted DOM checks passed on a source page, creator page, and search modal;
- full live mixed visual QA passed: 66 checks, 0 failures, 0 warnings.

Next step:

- stage allowlisted public-safe files, commit, push `main`, then continue check-only TikTok intake and GSC indexing.

## 2026-06-11 — Topic page IA compaction and ay43 deploy

User marked the topic-page metrics block and asked to remove the separate `Share Topic Page` bar plus the standalone public insight/source/creator metric row. The requested product direction was to make `Topic Evidence Page` the single hero/control block and keep its width aligned with lower sections.

Actions taken:

- changed topic-page generation so share icons render inline inside the `Topic evidence page` hero without a visible `Share Topic Page` label;
- moved public insight card, source record, and creator counts into compact hero stats;
- removed the standalone topic `metric-row`;
- made topic hero width match `content-section` width across desktop, narrow desktop, and mobile;
- bumped Base2026 static cache-bust to `20260611-topicia2`;
- deployed `base2026-topic-ia-ay43-20260611` with `-SkipReindex`.

Next step:

- stage allowlisted public-safe files, commit, push `main`, then continue check-only TikTok intake and GSC indexing.

## 2026-06-11 — Roadmap status marker compaction and ay44 deploy

User marked the roadmap execution-order cards and called out that status values were visually heavier than the actual roadmap items, especially on mobile.

Actions taken:

- converted roadmap status rendering to compact public labels such as `Done`, `Live`, `In progress`, `Planned`, `Research`, and `Next`;
- preserved full internal status strings in tooltip/ARIA so `Completed - Built In-House` remains available without dominating the layout;
- split roadmap status styles from normal pill styles so statuses are 10px, 17px high, borderless, and non-wrapping;
- kept mobile roadmap priority rows as text plus compact status, instead of stacking statuses as separate blocks;
- regenerated public/info pages, bumped Base2026 cache-bust to `20260611-roadmapstatus1`, and deployed `base2026-roadmap-status-ay44-20260611` with `-SkipReindex`.

Verification:

- Python compile and JS syntax checks passed;
- publication boundary audit passed with `forbidden=0`, `secret_findings=0`, `needs_review=0`;
- GitHub metadata validation passed;
- package-layout QA passed on desktop 1159px and mobile 390px;

Next step:

- stage allowlisted public-safe files, commit, push `main`, then continue GSC indexing and check-only TikTok intake hardening.

## 2026-06-11 — Mobile search filters, header parity, hashtag topics, and ay46 deploy

User pointed out that `/knowledge/` mobile filters were effectively hidden below results and asked for a visible, ergonomic filter control near the search flow. The same pass also continued the Base2026 launch UX cleanup for header parity and source metadata/tag consistency.

Actions taken:

- added a visible mobile `Filters` control under the search command on `/knowledge/`;
- implemented a native fixed filter drawer with creator, source, and year refinements plus backdrop/close/Escape handling;
- aligned Base2026 static headers with the WordPress avatar header and added desktop/mobile Base2026 navigation menus;
- moved source-page `excerpt only` and insight count metadata into the hero tool row;
- changed source/topic keywords to orange hashtag-style links instead of framed pills;
- fixed the deploy package template `web/static/meili.html` and cache-bust so live `/knowledge/` receives the mobile filter/header changes;
- deployed `base2026-mobile-filters-header-tags-ay46-20260611` with Meilisearch reindex.

Verification:

- Python compile, JS syntax, and `git diff --check` passed;
- public export policy check passed: 957 source records, 1396 passages, 1692 insight cards, 1228 public insight cards;
- publication boundary audit passed with `forbidden=0`, `secret_findings=0`, `needs_review=0`;
- GitHub metadata validation passed;
- live Playwright QA passed for mobile `/knowledge/`, mobile/desktop source page, and homepage mobile step-card state with no horizontal overflow and 0 console errors.

Next step:

- stage audited public-safe files, commit, push `main`, then continue GSC indexing and the reviewed intake pipeline.

## 2026-06-11 — ay51 ASR pipeline refresh and deploy

User asked to run the whole pipeline because new videos may have appeared, process them, and deploy after the work.

Actions taken:

- ran `hermes-tiktok-refresh.ps1 -CheckOnly -PlaylistEnd 1000`; no new TikTok inventory rows were added after ay50;
- confirmed current active TikTok state: 3008 total inventory rows, 1209 active rows, 1206 transcribed, 0 queued transcripts, 0 `needs_asr`, and 3 `needs_source_review`;
- rebuilt SQLite from current local sources;
- ran `kb-audit.py` and public export policy validation;
- exported public TikTok data as excerpt-only with 1209 source records and 1696 passages;
- fixed `scripts/tiktok-process-transcripts.ps1` for macOS ASR: POSIX-safe yt-dlp output templates, h264-first audio fallback selection, and local `base2026-worker.py transcribe` instead of missing `whisper` CLI;
- fixed `scripts/package-public-release.ps1` so CSS/JS cache-bust uses the release name instead of a stale hardcoded value;
- added `scripts/tiktok-process-transcripts.ps1` to the public-safe audit/staging allowlists;
- deployed `base2026-asr-pipeline-ay51-20260611` to VPS and reindexed Meilisearch with 1696 passages.

Verification:

- `build-kb-sqlite.py`: creators=4, transcripts=1206, source_cards=1206, chunks=1922, queued_asr_jobs=0;
- `kb-audit.py`: `audit=PASS`;
- `check-public-export-policy.py`: `ok=true`, `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- `audit-publication-boundary.py`: 0 forbidden, 0 secret findings, 0 needs review;
- `validate-github-metadata.py`: ok;
- live `/knowledge/static/documents.jsonl`: 1209 rows, no public full transcript/claims fields;
- live source pages `7649635621287316743`, `7649262955514580232`, and `7647809342548266258`: 200, `Source Excerpt` present, old empty-source text absent;
- live mobile visual QA: 44 checks, 0 failures, evidence under ignored `output/evidence/ay51-live-mobile-qa/`.

Not completed automatically:

- 265 clean transcripts still need faithful polish/QA before being considered final-quality polished transcript text;
- 3 source records remain in `needs_source_review`;
- no unreviewed insight-card candidates were promoted.

Next step:

- stage, commit, and push the public-safe ay51 pipeline/memory changes, then continue faithful transcript polish and evidence-gated insight-card backfill as separate quality queues.

## 2026-06-11 — Creator index, dropdown hover, and green Base2026 CTA ay49

User reported that the `/knowledge/creators/` index looked empty and unfinished, the Base2026 desktop dropdown disappeared before the pointer could reach the submenu, and the main WordPress site had lost the acid-green Base2026 CTA treatment.

Actions taken:

- rebuilt `/knowledge/creators/` cards with creator avatars, source counts, public-insight counts, attribution copy, profile links, and TikTok profile links;
- added a hover bridge to the Base2026 desktop header dropdown so the submenu remains reachable;
- deployed `base2026-creator-index-dropdown-ay49-20260611` with `-SkipReindex`;
- deployed WordPress child theme CSS `1.5.40`;
- added hover-bridge/light-dropdown styling to the WordPress desktop Base2026 submenu;
- added an acid-green Base2026 footer button and WordPress content blocks for the homepage and services page.

Verification:

- live `/knowledge/creators/` shows 4 creator cards, 4 avatars, 4 TikTok profile links, and no horizontal overflow;
- live WordPress and Base2026 desktop dropdown hover paths stay open and reach the `Search` submenu link;
- live homepage has the Base2026 block, live services page has the Base2026 service card, and live footer has the acid-green Base2026 button;
- evidence under ignored `output/evidence/ay49-creator-cta-live/`.

Next step:

- run publication boundary and metadata audits, stage allowlisted public-safe files, commit, push, then continue launch monitoring and the reviewed intake pipeline.

## 2026-06-11 — TikTok refresh ay50, Mac pipeline fixes, and deploy

User asked to run the pipeline for newly available TikToks, finish work to Git, and deploy after verification.

Actions taken:

- ran `hermes-tiktok-refresh.ps1 -CheckOnly -PlaylistEnd 50`: no new rows at that depth;
- ran full refresh with `PlaylistEnd 100`, which discovered 49 new `@joshuamaraney` rows;
- ran `-AfterPolish` with default `PlaylistEnd 1000`, which expanded the full `@joshuamaraney` archive to 638 rows and left older rows out of active scope where applicable;
- polished the one caption-ready transcript in batch `hermes-polish-20260611-144528`: `tiktok-video-7648365806375488782`;
- fixed Mac runner portability in `hermes-tiktok-refresh.ps1` and `tiktok-polish-runner.ps1` by resolving `python3`/`python` and `pwsh`/`powershell` dynamically;
- fixed `build-kb-sqlite.py` so SQLite rebuilds are deterministic: stale rows are cleared, and missing TikTok creators/source registry rows are auto-registered from `videos.csv`;
- extended the publication-boundary allowlist for the newly public-safe pipeline scripts;
- rebuilt SQLite, exported public TikTok data, packaged, deployed, and reindexed Meilisearch as `base2026-tiktok-refresh-ay50-20260611`.

Verification:

- `kb-audit.py` passes with `integrity=ok`, `foreign_key_errors=0`, 941 transcripts/source cards, and 266 queued ASR jobs;
- public export policy passes with `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- ay50 public export has 1209 source records, 1373 passages, 1538 insight cards, 1097 public insight cards, 1442 topics, and 1040 public topics;
- live `/knowledge/static/documents.jsonl` has 1209 rows;
- live Meilisearch proxy returns hits after reindex;
- live source page `/knowledge/sources/tiktok-video-7648365806375488782.html` now contains the polished OpenAI/ChatGPT Sites source excerpt;
- mobile visual QA passed: 44 checks, 0 failures, evidence under ignored `output/evidence/ay50-live-mobile-qa/`.

Not complete:

- 266 ASR jobs remain queued; many newly discovered source records are published only as attribution/source shells until transcript extraction succeeds;
- no unreviewed new insight cards were auto-promoted.

Next step:

- commit/push the public-safe pipeline script and memory updates, then run a focused ASR/source-review slice before the next card-promotion pass.

## 2026-06-11 — Unified mobile navigation across WordPress and Base2026

User reported that the WordPress hamburger menu and Base2026 hamburger menu had diverged: the WordPress drawer was dark and navigated directly from `Base2026`, while the Base2026 drawer was light but had an awkward pre-open submenu and inconsistent CTA hover behavior.

Actions taken:

- injected the same Base2026 submenu into the WordPress Kadence menu from `functions.php`;
- changed the WordPress mobile `Base2026` parent click so it opens the submenu instead of navigating away;
- restyled the WordPress mobile drawer as the same compact light floating panel used by Base2026;
- changed Base2026 generated headers so the mobile Base2026 submenu is closed by default and opens in-place;
- bumped Base2026 cache-bust to `20260611-mobilemenu1`;
- deployed Base2026 release `base2026-mobile-menu-unified-ay47b-20260611`;
- deployed WordPress child theme CSS `1.5.38`.

Verification:

- live WordPress mobile menu: `Base2026` click stays on the current page, submenu changes from hidden to grid, submenu links are 13.5px, horizontal overflow is 0, console errors are 0;
- live Base2026 mobile menu: submenu is closed by default, opens in place, panel is the same light floating style, horizontal overflow is 0, console errors are 0;
- evidence under ignored `output/evidence/mobile-menu-unified-final-v2/`.

Next step:

- stage audited public-safe files, commit, push `main`, then continue GSC indexing and the reviewed intake pipeline.

## 2026-06-11 — Base2026 mobile menu spacing hotfix and ay48 deploy

User pointed out that the Base2026 mobile drawer still looked wrong: the `Base2026` item appeared pressed into the left edge of the panel and the translucent drawer allowed the page breadcrumb behind it to visually bleed through.

Actions taken:

- made the Base2026 mobile drawer background opaque `#fffaf0` instead of translucent;
- increased mobile drawer internal padding;
- added a stronger left offset for the Base2026 submenu links;
- bumped Base2026 cache-bust to `20260611-mobilemenu2`;
- deployed `base2026-mobile-menu-padding-ay48-20260611` with `-SkipReindex`.

Verification:

- live `/knowledge/` mobile QA confirmed CSS `20260611-mobilemenu2`;
- drawer panel background is opaque `rgb(255, 250, 240)`;
- Base2026 summary offset is 17px from panel left;
- first submenu link offset is 39px from panel left;
- horizontal overflow is 0 and console errors are 0;
- evidence under ignored `output/evidence/base2026-mobile-menu-padding-ay48-live/`.

Next step:

- stage audited public-safe files, commit, push `main`, then continue GSC indexing and the reviewed intake pipeline.

## 2026-06-11 — Full creator TikTok refresh and ay52 deploy

User asked to run the whole pipeline because new videos may have appeared, process them, and deploy after the work.

Actions taken:

- verified repo status and project memory before running intake;
- ran the default check-only refresh and confirmed the tracked discovery config only covers `@joshuamaraney` and `@webhivedigital`;
- created an ignored `.planning` runtime config for all four indexed TikTok creators and ran full check-only inventory at playlist depth 1000;
- found 5 new active rows: 3 for `@build_in_public` and 2 for `@tjrobertson52`;
- canonicalized the temporary `@build_in_public` creator id back to existing `tiktok-build-in-public`;
- transcribed all 5 new videos from captions; ASR fallback was not needed;
- ran deterministic faithful polish for the 5 new clean transcripts: 3 passed, 2 retained honest `needs_review` QA flags because the raw caption text may need audio/source review;
- rebuilt SQLite, ran `kb-audit.py`, exported public TikTok data, and validated excerpt-only public export policy;
- generated 21 local insight-card candidates for the 5 new sources, evidence-verified all 21, promoted 6 reviewed candidates, and left 15 private as `needs_human`;
- deployed `base2026-tiktok-refresh-ay52-20260611` and reindexed Meilisearch with 1703 passages.

Verification:

- public export policy passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- live export counts: 1214 source records, 1703 passages, 1559 insight cards, 1103 public insight cards, 1452 topics, 1044 public topics;
- live `/knowledge/static/documents.jsonl` has 1214 rows and includes all 5 new videos;
- all 5 new source pages return 200, contain `Source Excerpt`, and do not show the old empty-source message;
- the 6 promoted public-card claim texts are present on the expected live source pages;
- live mixed WordPress/Base2026 visual QA passed with 66 checks and 0 failures.

Not complete:

- reviewed candidate imports/promotions are not yet durable across a clean `build-kb-sqlite.py` rebuild; future card backfill needs a replay/persistence layer before being called fully production-grade;
- 794 historical transcript polish QA files still say `needs_review`;
- 3 source-review rows remain;
- 15 ay52 candidates remain private as `needs_human`.

Next step:

- stage audited public-safe script/docs changes, commit, push `main`, then implement durable reviewed-candidate replay before the next larger card backfill.

## 2026-06-11 — Durable candidate replay, full refresh check, and ay53 deploy

User asked to run the whole pipeline again because new videos may have appeared, process them, and deploy after the work.

Actions taken:

- implemented durable approved-candidate replay:
  - `scripts/base2026-promote-insight-candidates.py` now archives promoted `insight_card_candidate` rows to ignored `12_knowledge-base/sources/tiktok/insight-candidates/reviewed-candidates.jsonl`;
  - `scripts/build-kb-sqlite.py` now replays `approved/reviewed/public` candidate rows from that ignored archive during clean SQLite rebuilds;
  - `scripts/kb-audit.py` now allows the expected claim-count difference when it equals the `insight_card_candidate` count;
- backfilled the ignored reviewed-candidate archive from the 6 already approved ay52 candidates;
- fixed `scripts/hermes-tiktok-refresh.ps1` so its final public export uses `--auto-promote-insights` and does not accidentally publish a reduced public-card export;
- ran full all-creator TikTok refresh with `.planning/tiktok-intake-all-creators-20260611.json`;
- found 0 new videos: `@build_in_public` added 0, `@tjrobertson52` added 0, `@joshuamaraney` added 0, `@webhivedigital` added 0;
- confirmed 0 queued transcripts, 0 `needs_asr`, 0 queued ASR jobs, and 0 missing polish files;
- rebuilt SQLite, exported public TikTok data, packaged, deployed, and reindexed Meilisearch as `base2026-pipeline-refresh-ay53-20260611`.

Verification:

- clean SQLite rebuild imported `reviewed_candidate_claims=6`;
- `kb-audit.py` passed;
- `check-public-export-policy.py public-data/tiktok` passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`, 1214 source records, 1703 passages, 1544 insight cards, 1103 public insight cards, 1446 topics, and 1044 public topics;
- publication boundary audit passed with 0 forbidden paths and 0 secret findings;
- GitHub metadata validation passed;
- live deploy current symlink points to `/var/www/base2026-knowledge/releases/base2026-pipeline-refresh-ay53-20260611`;
- live `/knowledge/`, sample source page, sample creator page, sitemap, and `documents.jsonl` checks passed;
- live `documents.jsonl` has 1214 rows with no `claims` field and no full transcript fields;
- live static CSS/JS return gzip and immutable cache headers;
- mixed WordPress/Base2026 visual QA passed: 66 checks, 0 failures, evidence under ignored `output/evidence/mobile-visual-qa-live-ay53/`.

Next step:

- stage audited public-safe script/docs changes, commit, push `main`, then continue the source-review/transcript-QA queue and GSC/GA4 launch monitoring.

## 2026-06-11 — ay54 private-candidate export gate and full default refresh

User asked to run the whole pipeline again because new videos may have appeared, process them, and deploy after all work.

Actions taken:

- ran a full default TikTok refresh and found a configuration problem: the ignored dated queue checked only `@joshuamaraney` and `@webhivedigital`;
- reran the full refresh with the existing all-creator runtime config and verified all four public creators: `@build_in_public`, `@tjrobertson52`, `@joshuamaraney`, and `@webhivedigital`;
- found 0 new videos across all four creators, 0 queued transcripts, 0 `needs_asr`, 0 queued ASR jobs, and 0 missing polish files;
- added ignored `config/tiktok-intake-queue.local.json` locally with all four public creator sources so future default runs cover the whole current source set;
- updated committed `config/creators.example.json` to list the same four public TikTok creator sources with stable IDs;
- made private `needs_human` insight-card candidates durable by archiving report rows and replaying private queue statuses during clean local SQLite rebuilds;
- changed `export-public-tiktok.py` so non-public `insight_card_candidate` rows are excluded from public JSONL, not merely marked private;
- rebuilt SQLite, ran `kb-audit.py`, exported public TikTok data, packaged, deployed, and reindexed Meilisearch as `base2026-private-candidate-gate-ay54-20260611`.

Verification:

- clean SQLite rebuild imported `reviewed_candidate_claims=21`;
- `kb-audit.py` passed;
- `check-public-export-policy.py public-data/tiktok` passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`, 1214 source records, 1703 passages, 1544 insight cards, 1103 public insight cards, 1452 topics, and 1044 public topics;
- live deploy current symlink points to `/var/www/base2026-knowledge/releases/base2026-private-candidate-gate-ay54-20260611`;
- live `insight_cards.jsonl` has 1544 rows, 6 approved candidate cards, and 0 private candidates exported;
- live `documents.jsonl` has 1214 rows and 0 transcript/claim leaks;
- live `/knowledge/`, sitemap, creators index, sample source page, and sample topic page return 200;
- live static CSS/JS return gzip and immutable cache headers;
- publication boundary audit, GitHub metadata validation, and `git diff --check` passed.

Next step:

- stage audited public-safe changes, commit, push `main`, then continue with source-review/transcript-QA cleanup and GSC/GA4 launch monitoring.

## 2026-06-11 — Source-review audit gate after ay54

User asked to bring the project to Git with senior engineering discipline and no sloppy manual state.

Actions taken:

- added `scripts/tiktok-source-review-audit.py` to make parked TikTok `needs_source_review` rows auditable without publishing private source data;
- ran the audit with network probing and confirmed 3 parked rows:
  - 2 older `@tjrobertson52` fallback MP4 files have no audio stream and no subtitles;
  - 1 newer `@tjrobertson52` source is currently blocked by TikTok IP access;
- ran full transcript polish audit over 1211 polished transcripts: 0 high-risk flags, 794 `needs_review`, 417 low/pass;
- confirmed public export counts remain ay54: 1214 source records, 1703 passages, 1544 insight cards, 1103 public insight cards, 1452 topics;
- confirmed SQLite candidate queue remains 6 approved public candidate cards and 15 private `needs_human` candidates;
- updated project memory, data-source notes, status board, active queue, and publication audit allowlist for the new public-safe audit script.

Verification:

- `python3 scripts/tiktok-source-review-audit.py --probe-network --out .planning/source-review-audit-20260612-rerun.json` passed;
- `python3 scripts/tiktok-polish-audit.py --limit 2000 --json` passed with `high_risk=0`;
- `python3 scripts/check-public-export-policy.py public-data/tiktok` passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- `python3 scripts/validate-github-metadata.py` passed;
- `python3 -m py_compile` passed for the touched/related pipeline scripts.

Next step:

- rerun publication boundary audit, stage only public-safe script/docs changes, commit, push `main`, then continue the 794 transcript-QA batch review and 15 private card-candidate rewrite/review queue.

## 2026-06-11 — Controller-backed transcript QA and stricter candidate review

User asked to keep working toward production level without sloppy automation or AI slop.

Actions taken:

- upgraded `scripts/tiktok-polish-audit.py` so it can emit filtered transcript-QA batches by risk and QA status, write JSON/Markdown reports under ignored `.planning/`, and report full risk/QA status counts;
- added controller commands for `tiktok-polish-audit` and `tiktok-source-review-audit` so QA work is traceable in `.planning/runs`;
- synced `scripts/stage-public-files.ps1` with the source-review audit script so publication staging and publication audit allowlists do not drift;
- hardened `scripts/base2026-review-insight-candidates.py`:
  - flags speculative claim language;
  - flags generic and overbroad suggested actions;
  - counts existing approved/reviewed/public candidate cards per source before recommending more promotions.

Verification:

- `python3 scripts/base2026-controller.py tiktok-polish-audit --limit 25 --risk review --qa-status needs_review ...` passed and produced a 25-row private QA batch from 794 review rows;
- `python3 scripts/base2026-controller.py tiktok-source-review-audit --probe-network ...` passed and confirmed the 3 source-review blocker reasons;
- `python3 scripts/base2026-controller.py review-insight-candidates --status needs_human ...` now keeps all 15 private candidates as `needs_human`;
- `python3 scripts/base2026-controller.py doctor` passed with the new audit tools detected.

Next step:

- run publication/preflight gates, commit/push the public-safe tooling/memory changes, then continue the transcript-QA batches and private card rewrite queue.

## 2026-06-12 — Full TikTok pipeline refresh and ay55 deploy

User asked to run the whole pipeline because new videos may have appeared, process them, and deploy after all work.

Actions taken:

- ran the full four-creator TikTok refresh through `scripts/hermes-tiktok-refresh.ps1` with the ignored local queue config;

- commit and push public-safe tooling/memory changes; continue transcript QA triage slices and retry the remaining TikTok IP-blocked source only when accessible.

## 2026-06-12 — ay58 full creator refresh, candidate resolver, transcript QA slice, deploy

User asked to run the whole pipeline because new videos may have appeared, process them, deploy after all work, and bring public-safe changes to Git.

Actions taken:

- ran `scripts/hermes-tiktok-refresh.ps1` against ignored `config/tiktok-intake-queue.local.json` with the latest 80 public posts per configured creator;
- refresh found 0 new videos, 0 queued transcripts, 0 `needs_asr`, 0 queued ASR jobs, and 0 missing polish files;
- added `scripts/base2026-resolve-candidate-decisions.py` and controller wiring so old reviewed `needs_human` candidate rows are resolved after rewrite/reject decisions instead of reappearing after clean rebuilds;
- applied the resolver to the ignored private reviewed-candidates archive and local SQLite: 8 old rows marked `reject_candidate` because they were superseded by rewritten approved cards, 5 marked `rejected`, 2 left private as `needs_human`;
- ran a conservative transcript-QA human-text slice: 8 clean technical artifact rows passed, 17 source-sensitive rows stayed `needs_review`;
- rebuilt SQLite, exported public TikTok data, deployed `base2026-pipeline-refresh-ay58-20260612`, and reindexed Meilisearch.

Verification:

- public export policy passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`, 1214 source records, 1707 passages, 1552 insight cards, 1111 public insight cards, 1460 topics, and 1052 public topics;
- source-review audit still has 1 private blocker: `tiktok-video-7648746368739118350`, blocked by TikTok IP access;

- refresh found 0 new videos, 0 queued transcripts, 0 `needs_asr`, 0 queued ASR jobs, and 0 missing polish files;
- imported one additional exact-evidence Fable/software-engineering insight card through the private reviewed-candidate archive before this run, then rebuilt/exported the public dataset;
- retried the source-review audit with network probing; the only remaining source-review row is still blocked by TikTok IP access;
- deployed `base2026-night-card-refresh-ay59-20260612` and reindexed Meilisearch.

Verification:

- public export policy passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`, 1214 source records, 1707 passages, 1553 insight cards, 1112 public insight cards, 1460 topics, and 1053 public topics;

Next step:

- continue controlled transcript-QA slices and retry the remaining TikTok IP-blocked source when access is available; keep the remaining private `needs_human` candidate unpublished until source/audio evidence resolves it.

## 2026-06-12 — ay60 human-text transcript QA slice and deploy

User's overnight goal is to keep closing the honest launch-quality gaps without bulk-passing uncertain transcript text or publishing private/raw material.

Actions taken:

- reran private `needs_human` card review: 1 candidate remains private because the evidence text still needs source/audio verification;
- reran source-review audit with network probing: 1 `@tjrobertson52` source remains blocked by TikTok IP access;
- generated full transcript QA triage and selected the 17 human-text review rows for a controlled slice;
- corrected 8 obvious polished-transcript artifacts: mojibake, duplicated caption tokens, `M dashes`/`em dashes`, `SEO. S`, `spamy`, domain casing, and numeric formatting;
- kept 9 source-sensitive rows in `needs_review` rather than guessing damaged phrases;
- applied an explicit private QA manifest with audit trail, rebuilt SQLite, exported public data, deployed `base2026-transcript-qa-ay60-20260612`, and reindexed Meilisearch.

Verification:

- transcript QA debt moved from 786 to 778 rows;
- current QA triage: 576 audio-verification rows, 193 entity/spelling rows, and 9 human text-review rows;
- public export policy passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`, 1214 source records, 1707 passages, 1553 insight cards, 1112 public insight cards, 1460 topics, and 1053 public topics;
- SQLite audit, controller doctor, publication boundary audit, GitHub metadata validation, and Python compile passed;
- live `documents.jsonl` has 1214 rows, 0 transcript payloads, 0 raw `claims` fields, and 0 mojibake rows;
- live corrected-source smoke confirmed `If you are not making short YouTube videos...` and no old `If you you are` text;
- live mixed mobile visual QA passed with 66 checks and 0 failures, evidence under ignored `output/evidence/mobile-visual-qa-live-20260612-ay60/`.

Next step:

- continue transcript QA through smaller audio/entity/source-verification batches; keep the remaining private card and IP-blocked source parked until stronger evidence is available.

## 2026-06-12 — ay62 intake refresh, public-text cleanup, and deploy

User asked to run the full pipeline because new TikToks may have appeared, process anything new, deploy after the work, and keep the project Git-ready.

Verification:

- public export policy passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- transcript QA debt moved from 778 to 777 rows: 575 audio-verification rows, 193 entity/spelling rows, and 9 human text-review rows;
- source-review audit still has 1 private blocker: `tiktok-video-7648746368739118350`, blocked by TikTok IP access;
- live `/knowledge/` contains the ay62 release marker;
- live `documents.jsonl` has 1214 rows, 0 mojibake rows, and 0 unsafe public full-transcript/raw-caption/claims fields;
- live Meilisearch search proxy returned results for `AI Overviews`;
- live mixed mobile visual QA passed with 66 checks and 0 failures, evidence under ignored `output/evidence/mobile-visual-qa-live-20260612-ay62/`.

Next step:

- commit and push public-safe memory updates, then continue controlled transcript QA slices and retry the IP-blocked TikTok source when network access allows.

## 2026-06-12 — ay65 text/entity QA cleanup and deploy

Continuation of the overnight production-hardening task after ay64 deploy.

Actions taken:

- reran transcript QA triage and confirmed 626 remaining review rows: 611 audio-verification, 6 entity/spelling, and 9 human text-review;
- added durable local normalizer rules for source-backed text/entity artifacts including Eli Schwartz, r/MinMaxMarketing, Google My Business, Copilot, and spoken Gemini version references;

- moved 7 source-backed text/entity rows to QA pass and explicitly kept 8 unsafe rows review-gated with audio/source verification reasons;
- rebuilt SQLite, exported public data, deployed `base2026-text-qa-cleanup-ay65-20260612`, and reindexed Meilisearch.

Verification:

- SQLite audit passed with 1214 polished transcripts, 1215 source records, and 1708 passages;
- public export policy passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- transcript QA triage is now 619 review flags, all categorized as audio/source-verification required;
- live public JSONL scan found 0 tracked old text/entity tokens and confirmed corrected public names;
- live mixed mobile visual QA passed with 66 checks and 0 failures.

Next step:

- continue audio/source-verification QA in controlled slices; do not bulk-pass the remaining 619 rows without stronger evidence.

## 2026-06-12 — ay64 source-backed entity QA cleanup and deploy

User asked to run the whole pipeline because new videos may have appeared, process them, and deploy after all work.

Actions taken:

- confirmed the previous post-ay63 intake scan found 0 new videos across the configured public creator queue;
- fixed `scripts/tiktok-qa-triage.py` so boilerplate local polish notes no longer inflate the entity queue and audio/source-verification notes classify correctly;
- expanded durable TikTok entity normalization in `scripts/tiktok-normalize-polished-entities.py` and `scripts/tiktok-faithful-polish-local.py` for source-backed public ASR/entity artifacts;
- applied an explicit ignored QA manifest for 11 source-backed entity rows, moving them from private QA review to pass;
- rebuilt SQLite, exported public data, deployed `base2026-entity-qa-cleanup-ay64-20260612`, and reindexed Meilisearch.

Verification:

- SQLite audit passed with 1214 polished transcripts, 1215 source records, and 1708 passages;
- public export policy passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- transcript QA triage is now 626 review flags: 611 audio-verification rows, 6 entity/spelling rows, and 9 human text-review rows;
- live public JSONL scan found 0 tracked old ASR/entity tokens;
- targeted live source-page smoke checks confirmed corrected public names such as `Gary Illyes`, `n8n`, `Comet browser`, `Schemawriter.ai`, `Descript`, `Claude Projects`, `sourceofsources.com`, and `NPR`;
- live mixed mobile visual QA passed with 66 checks and 0 failures.

Next step:

- commit/push public-safe script and memory updates, then continue controlled transcript QA slices and retry the IP-blocked TikTok source when network access allows.

## 2026-06-12 — ay62 follow-up false-positive transcript QA cleanup

Continuation of the overnight launch-quality task after ay62 deploy.

Actions taken:

- reran transcript QA triage, private `needs_human` candidate review, and source-review audit;
- confirmed the remaining `needs_human` insight candidate should stay private because its evidence text is damaged (`click UPS`), action is empty, and the source already has public cards;
- selected only entity/spelling QA rows whose notes were boilerplate local faithful-polish notes and whose clean/polished token streams matched after allowed acronym/entity normalization;
- applied an explicit private QA manifest that moved 131 false-positive entity rows from `needs_review` to `pass`;
- rebuilt SQLite, exported public data, and reran the public export policy gate.

Verification:

- transcript QA triage moved from 777 to 646 rows: 575 audio-verification rows, 62 real entity/spelling rows, and 9 human text-review rows;
- public export counts remained unchanged: 1214 source records, 1707 passages, 1553 insight cards, 1112 public insight cards, 1460 topics, and 1053 public topics;
- public export policy passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- `git diff` showed no public-data changes after rebuild/export, so no duplicate VPS deploy was needed beyond live `base2026-intake-refresh-ay62-20260612`.

Next step:

- continue only evidence-backed transcript QA slices; do not bulk-pass the remaining audio/source-sensitive rows without stronger evidence.

## 2026-06-12 — ay63 new TikTok intake, entity normalizer, and deploy

User asked to run the full TikTok pipeline again because new videos may have appeared, process them, and deploy after the work.

Actions taken:

- ran `scripts/hermes-tiktok-refresh.ps1` against ignored `config/tiktok-intake-queue.local.json`;
- refresh found 1 new `@joshuamaraney` video (`7650378444122901768`), added it to the local inventory, transcribed it from caption metadata, and produced a polish batch;
- ran local faithful polish for the new caption transcript and corrected the source-backed entity artifact `Jason Wang is a C O and founder` to `Jensen Huang is CEO and founder` using the official NVIDIA executive bio as the review source;
- added `scripts/tiktok-normalize-polished-entities.py` and expanded the existing local polish normalizer so obvious ASR/entity artifacts are fixed durably before public export;
- normalized existing private polished transcripts for public-facing artifacts including `s c o`, `Chat GBT`, `Chat GPT`, `Open AI`, `AR models`, `AR SEO`, `C m s`, `m dash`, and `Paypal`;
- rebuilt SQLite, exported public data, deployed `base2026-intake-entity-normalizer-ay63-20260612`, and reindexed Meilisearch.

Verification:

- public export policy passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- local export now has 1215 source records, 1708 passages, 1553 insight cards, 1112 public insight cards, 1460 topics, and 1053 public topics;
- current queues: 0 queued transcripts, 0 `needs_asr`, 0 queued ASR jobs, and 0 missing polish files;
- live source page `/knowledge/sources/tiktok-video-7650378444122901768.html` contains `Jensen Huang` and does not contain `Jason Wang`;
- live public JSONL scan found 0 matches for the tracked ASR-slop patterns;
- live mixed mobile visual QA passed with 66 checks and 0 failures, evidence under ignored `output/evidence/mobile-visual-qa-live-20260612-ay63/`.

Next step:

- commit/push public-safe script and memory updates, then continue controlled transcript QA slices and retry the IP-blocked TikTok source when network access allows.

## 2026-06-12 — post-ay63 no-new-video pipeline scan

User asked to run the whole TikTok pipeline again because new videos may have appeared, process them, and deploy after the work.

Actions taken:

- ran `scripts/hermes-tiktok-refresh.ps1` against ignored `config/tiktok-intake-queue.local.json` with `PlaylistEnd=160`, transcript processing, rebuild, SQLite audit, and public export;
- ran a deeper `PlaylistEnd=1000` check-only inventory pass after the rebuild/export pass;
- confirmed all four configured public creator sources returned 0 added rows and 0 updated rows;
- did not deploy a duplicate VPS release because the public payload did not change after rebuild/export.

Verification:

- current local inventory remains 3014 total rows, 1215 active rows, 0 queued transcripts, 0 `needs_asr`, 0 queued ASR jobs, and 0 missing polish files;
- public export policy passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- public export counts remained 1215 source records, 1708 passages, 1553 insight cards, 1112 public insight cards, 1460 topics, and 1053 public topics;
- publication boundary audit passed with 0 forbidden files and 0 secret findings;
- GitHub metadata validation passed;
- transcript QA triage remains 637 review flags: 583 audio-verification rows, 45 entity/spelling rows, and 9 human text-review rows;
- source-review audit still has 1 private blocker: `tiktok-video-7648746368739118350`, blocked by TikTok IP access.

Next step:

- continue controlled transcript QA slices and retry the IP-blocked TikTok source when network access allows; deploy only when the reviewed public payload changes.

## 2026-06-12 — ay66 full four-creator refresh, deploy, and live QA

User asked to run the whole pipeline because new videos may have appeared, process them, and deploy after the work.

Actions taken:

- ran `scripts/hermes-tiktok-refresh.ps1` against ignored `config/tiktok-intake-queue.local.json` with `PlaylistEnd=1000`, transcript processing, rebuild, SQLite audit, and public export;
- confirmed all four configured public creator sources returned 0 added rows and 0 updated rows: `@build_in_public` 1000 discovered, `@tjrobertson52` 347, `@joshuamaraney` 639, and `@webhivedigital` 1000;
- confirmed current queues remain 0 queued transcripts, 0 `needs_asr`, 0 queued ASR jobs, and 0 missing polish files;
- deployed `base2026-full-pipeline-refresh-ay66-20260612` and reindexed Meilisearch with 1708 passages.

Verification:

- `kb-audit.py` passed;
- `check-public-export-policy.py public-data/tiktok` passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`, 1215 source records, 1708 passages, 1553 insight cards, 1113 public insight cards, 1460 topics, and 1054 public topics;
- transcript QA triage remains 619 review flags, all `audio_verification_required`;
- source-review audit still has 1 private blocker: `tiktok-video-7648746368739118350`, blocked by TikTok IP access;
- private `needs_human` candidate review still has 1 candidate parked for source/audio verification;
- publication boundary audit and GitHub metadata validation passed;
- live endpoint smoke passed for `/knowledge/`, `/knowledge/static/documents.jsonl`, `/knowledge/sitemap.xml`, `/knowledge/roadmap.html`, and `/knowledge/creators/`;
- live mixed mobile visual QA passed with 66 checks and 0 failures, evidence under ignored `output/evidence/mobile-visual-qa-live-20260612-ay66/`.

Next step:

- stage/commit/push the public-safe memory updates, then continue controlled transcript QA slices and retry the IP-blocked TikTok source only when network/source access allows.

## 2026-06-12 — ay67 GPT/Codex no-card source review batch

User asked to stop using local models for card text work and use Codex/GPT review instead, then continue filling missing card content and deploy after verified work.

Actions taken:

- generated a source-only GPT/Codex review packet for 10 queued no-card sources from `.planning/backfill-insight-cards-20260612-newrun.jsonl`;
- reviewed the packet against public passages only, created 9 candidate insight cards, and skipped 1 source because the available text was not strong enough for a safe public card;
- evidence-verified all 9 candidates with exact source matches;
- imported the 9 candidates as private/pending, then ran `review-insight-candidates`;
- promoted only the 4 `promotion_candidate` rows and archived them in ignored `12_knowledge-base/sources/tiktok/insight-candidates/reviewed-candidates.jsonl`;
- left 5 exact-evidence candidates private because they tripped the source promotion-limit reviewer gate;
- rebuilt SQLite from the durable replay archive, ran `kb-audit.py`, exported the public TikTok layer, deployed `base2026-chatgpt-card-batch01-ay67-20260612`, and reindexed Meilisearch with 1708 passages.

Verification:

- local public export policy passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`, 1215 source records, 1708 passages, 1557 insight cards, 1117 public insight cards, 1464 topics, and 1058 public topics;
- live source page `/knowledge/sources/tiktok-video-7650000106489433352.html` contains the new `AI Workflow Automation` card context with `Claude` and `Google Calendar`;
- full live mixed visual QA passed with 66 checks and 0 failures, evidence under ignored `output/evidence/mobile-visual-qa-live-20260612-ay67/`;
- 619 transcript QA rows remain open because all require audio/source verification;
- `tiktok-video-7648746368739118350` remains parked because TikTok/IP access still blocks source review.

Next step:

- commit/push public-safe memory updates, then continue the same GPT/Codex source-only card-review lane in small batches; do not bulk-pass audio-sensitive transcript QA rows.

## 2026-06-12 — ay68 GPT/Codex no-card source review batches 02-03

User clarified that local models should not be used for the current public card text work and asked to use ChatGPT/Codex review instead.

Actions taken:

- built a freshly filtered no-card source queue after ay67;
- generated two source-only GPT/Codex review packets for 16 queued no-card sources;
- reviewed packet text against public passages only, created 13 new candidate insight cards, and skipped 3 weak or fragile sources rather than forcing public cards;
- evidence-verified all 13 candidates with exact source matches;
- imported the 13 candidates as private/pending, ran `review-insight-candidates`, promoted all 13 reviewer-approved candidates, and archived them in ignored `12_knowledge-base/sources/tiktok/insight-candidates/reviewed-candidates.jsonl`;
- rebuilt SQLite from the durable private replay archive, ran `kb-audit.py`, exported the public TikTok layer, deployed `base2026-chatgpt-card-batch02-03-ay68-20260612`, and reindexed Meilisearch with 1708 passages.

Verification:

- public export policy passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`, 1215 source records, 1708 passages, 1570 insight cards, 1129 public insight cards, 1473 topics, and 1066 public topics;
- live source page `/knowledge/sources/tiktok-video-7647713851504463117.html` contains the new `AI Content Workflow` card context;
- live topic page `/knowledge/topics/internal-linking.html` contains the new `Internal Linking` card context;
- full live mixed visual QA passed with 66 checks and 0 failures, evidence under ignored `output/evidence/mobile-visual-qa-live-20260612-ay68/`;
- 619 transcript QA rows remain open because all require audio/source verification;
- `tiktok-video-7648746368739118350` remains parked because TikTok/IP access still blocks source review.

Next step:

- commit/push public-safe memory updates, then continue the same GPT/Codex source-only card-review lane in small batches; rebuild a fresh filtered queue before each packet and do not bulk-pass audio-sensitive transcript QA rows.

## 2026-06-12 — ay73 source-modal document cache fix

User reported that a live `/knowledge/` search result opened `Source record unavailable` for `@joshuamaraney` / Google Ads Tracking even though the result card and source data existed.

Actions taken:

- traced the bug to immutable browser caching of `/knowledge/static/documents.jsonl`: live Meilisearch had the new result, but the modal lookup could read an older cached JSONL payload;
- changed `web/static/meili.js` so delayed static payload fetches include the release asset version and use `cache: "no-cache"`;
- changed `scripts/package-public-release.ps1` to inject `window.BASE2026_ASSET_VERSION` into packaged `/knowledge/`;
- deployed `base2026-documents-cachefix-ay73-20260612` and reindexed Meilisearch.

Verification:

- live root `/knowledge/` loads `static/meili.js?v=base2026-documents-cachefix-ay73-20260612`;
- in-app browser QA clicked result `tiktok-video-7649635621287316743` and confirmed the modal opens `Source record` with `@joshuamaraney`, `2026-06-10`, and the Google Ads Tracking excerpt;
- the old `Source record unavailable` and `Source record not found` states were absent in that flow;
- full live mixed visual QA passed with 66 checks and 0 failures, evidence under ignored `output/evidence/mobile-visual-qa-live-20260612-ay73-cachefix/`;
- `node --check web/static/meili.js` passed;
- `git diff --check` passed.

Next step:

- finish full live mixed visual QA, run publication boundary and metadata gates, stage/commit/push the public-safe ay73 fix, then return to GPT/Codex source-only card review.

## 2026-06-12 — ay70/ay71 GPT/Codex card batches, new TikTok intake, and deploy

User clarified that local models should not be used for current public card quality work and asked to use ChatGPT/Codex, preferably ChatGPT 5.5 Medium.

Actions taken:

- built a fresh no-card queue, filtered already processed sources, and reviewed two GPT/Codex source-only packets from public passages only;
- promoted 20 exact-evidence public cards from ay70 batches after `review-insight-candidates`, and rejected 1 over-source-limit candidate instead of forcing it public;
- ran the TikTok refresh against ignored `config/tiktok-intake-queue.local.json`, found 1 new `@build_in_public` source, downloaded captions, and kept ASR at 0;
- polished the new caption transcript through Codex/GPT review without local-model rewriting, then imported/promoted 2 exact-evidence public cards for the new source;
- rebuilt SQLite, ran `kb-audit.py`, exported the excerpt-only public layer, deployed `base2026-intake-gpt-cards-ay71-20260612`, and reindexed Meilisearch with 1709 passages.

Verification:

- public export policy passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`, 1216 source records, 1709 passages, 1607 insight cards, 1165 public insight cards, 1505 topics, and 1096 public topics;
- live source page `/knowledge/sources/tiktok-video-7650481268206931222.html` returns the new source excerpt;
- full live mixed visual QA passed with 66 checks and 0 failures, evidence under ignored `output/evidence/mobile-visual-qa-live-20260612-ay71/`;
- source-review audit still has 1 private blocker: `tiktok-video-7648746368739118350`, blocked by TikTok IP access;
- transcript QA triage still has 619 review flags, all `audio_verification_required`, and they were not bulk-passed.

Next step:

- run publication boundary and GitHub metadata gates, stage/commit/push public-safe memory and script/source changes only, then continue the GPT/Codex source-only review lane for remaining no-card sources.

## 2026-06-12 — ay72 roadmap status sync

User asked to mark completed roadmap items inside the roadmap itself so public statuses match actual work.

Actions taken:

- updated `docs/public-pages/01_ROADMAP.md` and `web/static/roadmap.js` so the public roadmap matches the ay71 pipeline reality;
- marked source metadata model and transcription workflow as completed;
- marked evidence-gated insight-card extraction/review, entity/topic cleanup, and moderation/review queue as in progress;
- marked source-backed public insight cards as live;
- regenerated/deployed `base2026-roadmap-status-sync-ay72-20260612` without changing public data counts and reindexed Meilisearch.

Verification:

- live `/knowledge/static/roadmap.js` contains the updated roadmap statuses;
- public export remained excerpt-only with 1216 source records, 1709 passages, 1607 insight cards, and 1165 public insight cards;
- publication boundary audit and GitHub metadata validation passed;
- full mixed live visual QA passed with 66 checks and 0 failures, evidence under ignored `output/evidence/mobile-visual-qa-live-20260612-ay72-roadmap/`.

Next step:

- commit/push the public-safe roadmap/status-sync source and memory updates, then continue the GPT/Codex source-only card-review lane.

## 2026-06-12 — ay69 GPT/Codex no-card source review batches 04-05

User clarified again that local models should not be used for the current public card text work and asked to use GPT/Codex review instead.

Actions taken:

- rebuilt a fresh no-card queue and filtered out already processed packet sources;
- generated two more source-only GPT/Codex review packets for 16 queued no-card sources;
- reviewed packet text against public passages only, created 15 new candidate insight cards, and skipped 1 giveaway/engagement source instead of forcing a weak public card;
- evidence-verified all 15 candidates with exact source matches;
- imported the 15 candidates as private/pending, ran `review-insight-candidates`, promoted all 15 reviewer-approved candidates, and archived them in ignored `12_knowledge-base/sources/tiktok/insight-candidates/reviewed-candidates.jsonl`;
- rebuilt SQLite from the durable private replay archive, ran `kb-audit.py`, exported the public TikTok layer, deployed `base2026-chatgpt-card-batch04-05-ay69-20260612`, and reindexed Meilisearch with 1708 passages.

Verification:

- public export policy passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`, 1215 source records, 1708 passages, 1585 insight cards, 1144 public insight cards, 1486 topics, and 1079 public topics;
- live source page `/knowledge/sources/tiktok-video-7646800096583044374.html` contains the new `Robots.txt` card context;
- live topic page `/knowledge/topics/faq-seo.html` contains the new `FAQ SEO` card context;
- live topic page `/knowledge/topics/ai-skills.html` contains the new `AI Skills` card context;
- full live mixed visual QA passed with 66 checks and 0 failures, evidence under ignored `output/evidence/mobile-visual-qa-live-20260612-ay69/`;
- 619 transcript QA rows remain open because all require audio/source verification;
- `tiktok-video-7648746368739118350` remains parked because TikTok/IP access still blocks source review.

Next step:

- commit/push public-safe memory updates, then continue the same GPT/Codex source-only card-review lane in small batches; rebuild a fresh filtered queue before each packet and do not bulk-pass audio-sensitive transcript QA rows.

## 2026-06-12 — Mobile interaction/cache-bust root-cause fix

User reported live mobile regressions: Base2026 mobile dropdown alignment, source-record modal layout, and homepage roadmap CTA appearing unresponsive on phone.

Actions:
- Diagnosed the Base2026 source/topic pages still shipping old `styles.css?v=20260611-creatorcta1` references because `generate-public-pages.py` ran after package-time cache-bust replacement.
- Fixed `scripts/package-public-release.ps1` to normalize CSS/JS cache-busts across every generated release HTML file after all generators run, including `../static/...` source/topic paths.
- Tightened Base2026 mobile source modal layout and fixed mobile Base2026 submenu width/alignment.
- Updated WordPress child theme to `1.5.41` with visible mobile roadmap-form focus/validation behavior for invalid submits.
- Deployed WordPress theme files with server backup and PHP/nginx checks.
- Deployed Base2026 `base2026-cachebust-mobilefix-ay76-20260612` and reindexed Meilisearch.

Verification:
- Live source page HTML now references `../static/styles.css?v=base2026-cachebust-mobilefix-ay76-20260612`.
- Live mobile Browser QA: Base2026 submenu width 296px, submenu links aligned, no horizontal overflow; source modal body starts at y=229; roadmap form focuses `ay_website` and adds attention state on invalid submit; console errors empty.
- Publication boundary audit and GitHub metadata validation passed.
- Full mixed live visual QA passed: 66 checks, 0 failures, evidence under ignored `output/evidence/mobile-visual-qa-live-20260612-ay76-mobile-interactions/`.

Next step:
- Commit/push public-safe source/docs changes after final git review; continue pipeline/card backlog separately.

Follow-up:

- Added mobile interaction gates to `scripts/mobile-visual-qa.mjs` for WordPress/Kadence hamburger drawer, Base2026 mobile submenu layout, homepage roadmap CTA focus, and source modal open/layout.
- Targeted live interaction gate passed: 12 checks, 0 failures.
- Full live interaction-gated mixed QA passed: 66 checks, 0 failures, evidence under ignored `output/evidence/mobile-visual-qa-live-20260612-ay76-full-interaction-gate/`.
- Base2026 `main` was pushed to GitHub at commit `5efa8643`; the WordPress theme branch `codex/wp-native-content-seo-foundation` was pushed at commit `7295c14`.

## 2026-06-12 — architecture/code audit council

User asked for a full project architecture/code audit with four independent expert roles, special attention to the BS2026/Base2026 text and insight pipeline, and no shallow first-take conclusion.

Actions taken:

- read the required project-memory files, deployment/automation runbooks, visual contract, publication boundary, and public GitHub audit docs;
- checked the active phase and current dirty working tree before audit work;
- ran four independent read-only expert passes: full-stack, systems architecture, QA/test architecture, and a skeptical opposing reviewer;
- reviewed the Base2026 TikTok intake, SQLite/review/export/package/deploy/search pipeline and the public/private boundary;
- used external security references for Meilisearch result sanitization, GitHub Actions permissions/secret handling, OWASP secret scanning, and Subresource Integrity;
- created `docs/project-memory/ARCHITECTURE_CODE_AUDIT_2026_06_12.md`.

Verification:

- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/*.py web/server.py` passed;
- `node --check web/static/meili.js` passed;
- `node --check web/static/share-actions.js` passed;
- `node --check scripts/mobile-visual-qa.mjs` passed;
- `python3 scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py` passed with `forbidden=0`, `needs_review=0`, and `secret_findings=0`;
- `python3 scripts/check-public-export-policy.py public-data/tiktok` passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`, 1216 source records, and 1709 passages;
- `python3 scripts/validate-github-metadata.py` passed;
- `python3 scripts/base2026-controller.py doctor` passed and wrote only ignored `.planning/runs/...` trace files;
- `python3 scripts/kb-audit.py` printed `audit=PASS`;
- `git diff --check` passed.

Next step:

- implement the audit's first recommended hardening step: a public release/promotion contract that makes full transcripts and implicit public auto-promotion impossible in the public release lane, then add shadow Meilisearch deploy and fixture-backed CI gates.

## 2026-06-12 — Public release contract and CI gate

User asked to stop patching symptoms, explain the unclear audit points, and complete the next safe step with a full automated audit/gate so future leaks are caught by code instead of manual browsing.

Actions taken:

- added `contracts/base2026.public-release-contract.json` as the machine-readable public release contract;
- added `scripts/validate-public-release-contract.py` to verify public release script wiring, generated-artifact git boundaries, export manifests, full-transcript leakage, and implicit public auto-promotion;
- removed `-IncludeFullTranscripts` from `scripts/package-public-release.ps1` and `scripts/deploy-public-vps.ps1`;
- removed public-path `--auto-promote-insights` from package/deploy/Hermes export flows;
- changed `scripts/package-public-release.ps1` to build through an ignored staged export directory before packaging, validate the staged export, and enforce a public-card retention floor before any package can replace live data;
- changed `scripts/hermes-tiktok-refresh.ps1` to stage and validate export output before copying it into `public-data/tiktok`;
- added positive and negative public-export fixtures under `tests/fixtures/`;
- expanded `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with public release contract checks, leaky-export rejection, auto-promote rejection, and broader JS syntax checks.

Verification:

- `python3 scripts/validate-public-release-contract.py` passed;
- `python3 scripts/check-public-export-policy.py tests/fixtures/public-export-valid` passed;
- `python3 scripts/validate-public-release-contract.py --export-dir tests/fixtures/public-export-valid` passed;
- leaky fixture failed as expected with `include_full_transcripts` and source transcript violations;
- auto-promote fixture failed as expected with `auto_promote_insights`, `review_status=pending`, and `promotion_method=auto_evidence_match` violations;
- package guard smoke correctly failed before release packaging when no-auto export reduced public insight cards from 1165 to 67;
- live mixed visual/interaction QA passed with 66 checks and 0 failures under ignored `output/evidence/mobile-visual-qa-live-20260612-contract-gate/`;
- publication boundary audit passed after adding only `contracts/`, public export fixtures, and the contract validator to the public-safe allowlist;
- fixed `scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py` so it audits staged files as well as unstaged/untracked files before public commits;
- current ignored `public-data/tiktok` intentionally fails the new promotion contract with 2197 violations because 1098 legacy public cards are still `auto_evidence_match`; it remains excerpt-only under the older export-policy gate and must not be used for a new no-auto data-changing deploy until reviewed migration is complete.

Next step:

- run full publication/metadata/live QA gates, then commit/push this contract hardening; the next data task is reviewed migration or deliberate reduction of the legacy auto-promoted public card set before any further Base2026 data deploy.

## 2026-06-12 — Legacy public insight-card repair lane

User clarified that borderline cards should be turned into good cards through a high-quality translation/rewrite lane, not discarded or guessed. User also noted that TikTok meaning can depend on visual context, so screenshots/frame evidence would be useful but should not become unmanaged manual work.

Actions taken:

- added `scripts/base2026-review-legacy-insights.py` to audit legacy `auto_evidence_match` public cards from the ignored public export against public passages and SQLite claim rows;
- separated legacy cards into deterministic approvals, GPT/Codex text-repair packets, visual-context cases, and rejects;
- blocked fragile transcript phrases from deterministic approval so rough transcript wording does not become public product copy;
- applied 22 deterministic exact-evidence approvals and 8 GPT/Codex-reviewed rewrites to SQLite with automatic local DB backups;
- added controller commands: `review-legacy-insights`, `apply-legacy-insight-report`, and `apply-legacy-insight-review`;
- added the new script to CI Python syntax checks and publication-boundary allowlist;
- documented the split text/visual migration decision in `DECISIONS.md`, `NEXT_ACTION.md`, `DATA_SOURCES.md`, and `STATUS_BOARD.csv`.

Verification:

- legacy review report now shows 30 `already_migrated`, 729 `repair_with_gpt`, and 339 `needs_visual_context` cards out of 1098 legacy public cards;
- `python3 scripts/base2026-controller.py doctor` passed and includes `legacy_insight_reviewer_exists=true`;
- no-auto smoke export passed public export policy with 1216 source records, 1709 passages, 1607 insight cards, and 97 public approved cards;
- no-auto smoke export passed the public release contract when the retention floor was not enforced;
- retention-floor contract correctly failed with baseline 1165, candidate 97, and floor ratio 0.8, so this export is not deployable yet.

Next step:

- continue GPT/Codex repair batches for the 729 text-repair cards and design a thumbnail/frame evidence lane before approving the 339 visual-context cards.

## 2026-06-13 — Mobile source-page excerpt truncation root-cause fix

User reported that Base2026 mobile source pages and source modals were cutting text in the middle of words or thoughts.

Actions taken:

- diagnosed two truncation layers: `scripts/export-public-tiktok.py` sliced `documents.excerpt` from transcript text, and `scripts/generate-public-pages.py` cropped source-page text again during rendering;
- changed public export excerpts to prefer already-public passage bodies and to shorten only on sentence/word boundaries with explicit `...`;
- changed source pages to render the public passage body for `Source Excerpt` and source-page `Related Passages`, avoiding silent cropped previews;
- added `scripts/validate-public-text-excerpts.py` to catch future silent prefix cuts between `documents.jsonl` and `passages.jsonl`;
- wired the new validator into `scripts/package-public-release.ps1` and public staging allowlist.

Verification:

- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/export-public-tiktok.py scripts/generate-public-pages.py scripts/validate-public-text-excerpts.py` passed;
- `python3 scripts/export-public-tiktok.py --out output/evidence/mobile-text-excerpt-export` produced 1216 source records and 1709 passages;
- `python3 scripts/validate-public-text-excerpts.py --data output/evidence/mobile-text-excerpt-export` passed with 1215 checked records;
- `python3 scripts/validate-public-text-excerpts.py --data public-data/tiktok` reproduced the existing live-data bug, including tails such as `coming ou` and `honest assess`;
- `python3 scripts/check-public-export-policy.py output/evidence/mobile-text-excerpt-export` passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- local mobile Playwright smoke against a package-like test site passed for the source page and `openTranscript()` modal path, with evidence screenshots under ignored `output/evidence/mobile-text-render-site/screens`;
- `git diff --check` passed;
- `python3 scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py` passed with `forbidden=0`, `needs_review=0`, and `secret_findings=0`.

Next step:

- package/deploy only after the legacy public-card retention-floor issue is resolved or via an explicitly approved data-preserving UI patch path; a fresh no-auto export is still not deployable because it drops public approved cards to 97.

## 2026-06-13 — Data-preserving mobile modal/text hotfix deploy

User showed that live mobile source modals still did not fit the phone viewport cleanly and that public excerpt text was still visibly cut on live Base2026 pages.

Actions taken:

- tightened the mobile source modal contract in `web/static/styles.css`: bounded dialog width/height inside mobile viewport, compact three-column header actions, compact metadata row, and overflow protection for transcript/caption text;
- added `scripts/repair-public-text-excerpts.py` to repair public document/source excerpts from already-public passage text without exposing full transcripts;
- added `scripts/package-public-hotfix-from-export.ps1` to package an explicitly approved data-preserving hotfix from current `public-data/tiktok` while preserving JSONL counts;
- added the new hotfix scripts to publication boundary/staging allowlists;
- packaged and deployed `base2026-mobile-modal-text-hotfix-ay78-20260613` with `-SkipReindex` because search passages/index content did not change.

Verification:

- Python compile passed for the changed Python scripts;
- PowerShell parser passed for the hotfix/staging scripts;
- repair check on a copied export repaired 1047 document/source excerpts and passed `validate-public-text-excerpts.py`;
- package gate passed `check-public-export-policy.py` with `include_full_transcripts=false`, 1216 source records, 1709 passages, 1607 insight cards, and 1165 public insight cards;
- package gate passed `validate-public-text-excerpts.py` with 1215 checked records;
- publication boundary audit passed with `forbidden=0`, `needs_review=0`, and `secret_findings=0`;
- local and live Playwright mobile smoke passed for a source page and source modal at `390x844`, with no horizontal overflow, modal bounds inside viewport, scrollable modal body, repaired excerpt tail visible, and live CSS cache-bust set to the ay78 release.
- full live mobile visual QA passed with 44 checks and 0 failures; evidence: `output/evidence/mobile-visual-qa-live-ay78/`.

Next step:

- continue legacy insight-card migration before a normal data-changing no-auto public release; use the data-preserving hotfix path only for explicitly approved UI/rendering fixes that preserve current public export counts.

## 2026-06-13 — Current card-quality queue repair packet

Delegated card-repair lane requested a read-only breakdown of current no-card/private/legacy card queues and the next safe GPT/Codex repair packet, without SQLite mutation, promotion, deploy, or private/raw transcript output.

Actions taken:

- confirmed active phase and public/private boundary from project-memory;
- checked current local export and SQLite read-only counts from the main local repo;
- generated read-only legacy review artifacts: `.planning/legacy-insight-review-current-card-quality-readonly.json` / `.md`;
- generated the next GPT/Codex legacy repair packet: `.planning/legacy-insight-repair-packet-next30.json` / `.md`;
- did not apply review decisions, mutate SQLite, promote cards, package a release, deploy, or print raw captions/full transcripts.

Verification:

- `python3 scripts/base2026-build-backfill-queue.py --dry-run` reports 1216 source records, 1709 passages, 1607 insight cards, 1165 public insight cards, 335 queued no-any-card sources after reviewed-no-card filtering, and 45 reviewed-no-card sources;
- direct export count check reports 1215 sources with passages, 380 sources with passages and no insight card, and 513 sources with passages but no public insight card;
- read-only SQLite check reports 85 `insight_card_candidate` rows: 69 approved, 1 `needs_human`, 9 `reject_candidate`, and 6 rejected; pending count is 0;
- legacy report still shows 1098 legacy `auto_evidence_match` public cards: 30 already migrated, 729 `repair_with_gpt`, and 339 `needs_visual_context`;
- `python3 scripts/check-public-export-policy.py public-data/tiktok` passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- `python3 scripts/validate-public-release-contract.py --export-dir public-data/tiktok --max-violations 5` failed as expected with legacy promotion-contract violations, so this export remains blocked for normal no-auto data deploys;
- `python3 scripts/base2026-controller.py doctor` passed;
- `python3 scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py` passed with `forbidden=0`, `needs_review=0`, and `secret_findings=0`.

Next step:

- run GPT/Codex/ChatGPT 5.5 Medium against `.planning/legacy-insight-repair-packet-next30.md`, then apply only reviewed JSON after parent-thread approval and the exact-evidence/release-contract gates.

## 2026-06-13 — Legacy repair chunk02 review-only worker output

Delegated CARD/LEGACY QUALITY LANE requested strict JSON review for `.planning/legacy-insight-repair-packet-after-5x30-chunk02.json`, with no SQLite mutation, promotion, deploy, or raw/full transcript output.

Actions taken:

- reviewed the supplied public passages and 30 legacy cards across 21 sources;
- wrote `.planning/legacy-insight-repair-review-after-5x30-chunk02.worker.json`;
- wrote `.planning/legacy-insight-repair-review-after-5x30-chunk02.worker.md`;
- kept all decisions as `rewrite` with exact public-passage evidence excerpts under 900 chars;
- narrowed risk-sensitive cards with compliance/verification/risk-avoid wording.

Verification:

- local JSON self-check: 30 decisions, max evidence 898 chars, max claim 203 chars, max action 154 chars;
- requested dry-run apply passed: `accepted=30`, `skipped={}`, `dry_run=true`, `updated=0`, `status_counts.approved=30`;
- SQLite was not mutated because `--apply` was not used.

Risk-edge claim IDs:

- `tiktok-claim-023`
- `tiktok-build-20260524-001`
- `tiktok-b036-claim-019`
- `tiktok-b036-claim-020`

## 2026-06-13 — Legacy repair after-12x30 chunk02 review-only worker output

Delegated LEGACY/CARD QUALITY LANE requested strict JSON review for `.planning/legacy-insight-repair-packet-after-12x30-chunk02.json`, with no SQLite mutation, promotion, deploy, or raw/full transcript output.

Actions taken:

- reviewed 30 legacy cards across 12 supplied-public-passage sources;
- wrote `.planning/legacy-insight-repair-review-after-12x30-chunk02.worker.json`;
- wrote `.planning/legacy-insight-repair-review-after-12x30-chunk02.worker.md`;
- kept all decisions as `rewrite` with exact public-passage evidence excerpts;
- narrowed risk-sensitive press-release, Reddit AMA, recommendation-content, and GBP-name cards with verification/compliance language.

Verification:

- local JSON self-check: 30 decisions, max evidence 417 chars, max claim 188 chars, max action 181 chars;
- requested dry-run apply passed: `accepted=30`, `skipped={}`, `dry_run=true`, `updated=0`, `status_counts.approved=30`;
- SQLite was not mutated because `--apply` was not used.

Risk-edge claim IDs:

- `tiktok-b021-claim-005`
- `tiktok-b020-claim-042`
- `tiktok-b020-claim-043`
- `tiktok-b020-claim-018`
- `tiktok-b019-claim-032`

## 2026-06-13 — Command-center review of forked card threads

User asked the parent thread to verify the forked card/legacy workstreams rather than trusting their final reports.

Actions taken:

- inspected the two forked Codex threads `Разобрать очередь карточек` and `Разобрать legacy insight cards`;
- verified their generated `.planning` artifacts exist in the main repo checkout;
- checked both packet schemas and compared claim IDs without printing raw/private source text;
- confirmed `.planning/legacy-public-insight-lane-20260613/legacy-insight-repair-packet-20260613-batch01.json` is a 25-card subset of `.planning/legacy-insight-repair-packet-next30.json`;
- accepted `next30` as the primary next repair packet and marked `batch01` as duplicate/archival context, not a parallel apply lane.

Verification:

- `git diff --check` passed;
- `python3 scripts/base2026-controller.py doctor` passed;
- `python3 scripts/check-public-export-policy.py public-data/tiktok` passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- `python3 scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py` passed with `forbidden=0`, `needs_review=0`, and `secret_findings=0`;
- `python3 scripts/validate-public-release-contract.py --export-dir public-data/tiktok --max-violations 5` still fails as expected on legacy auto-promotion violations.

Next step:

- run the GPT/Codex review pass only on `.planning/legacy-insight-repair-packet-next30.json` / `.md`; do not process `batch01` separately.

## 2026-06-13 — ay79-ay81 legacy contract, TikTok slice, clean replay deploy

User asked to stop drifting, finish the card/text pipeline work, process new TikTok sources, deploy, and verify the site end to end.

Actions taken:

- migrated legacy public cards away from public `auto_evidence_match` output through reviewed/approved SQLite state;
- processed 2 queued 2026-06-12 caption-backed TikTok sources through the GPT/Codex text lane with word-count preserving polish QA;
- rebuilt SQLite, exported public data, packaged/deployed ay80, and verified both new source pages live;
- found the clean-rebuild root cause: DB-only legacy approvals could be lost on rebuild and the first replay attempt duplicated `claim_evidence`;
- added clean-rebuild replay of ignored reviewed legacy insight archives to `scripts/build-kb-sqlite.py`;
- created local ignored `12_knowledge-base/sources/tiktok/insight-candidates/reviewed-legacy-insights.jsonl` with 967 reviewed legacy rows;
- fixed replay to delete previous claim evidence before inserting reviewed evidence;
- rebuilt from scratch, proved duplicate claim IDs are 0, packaged/deployed `base2026-clean-replay-pipeline-ay81-20260613`, and reindexed Meilisearch.

Verification:

- `python3 scripts/kb-audit.py` passed;
- `python3 scripts/check-public-export-policy.py public-data/tiktok` passed;
- `python3 scripts/validate-public-text-excerpts.py --data public-data/tiktok` passed;
- `python3 scripts/validate-public-release-contract.py --export-dir public-data/tiktok --baseline-export-dir output/releases/base2026-pipeline-two-sources-ay80-20260613/public-data/tiktok --enforce-count-floor --max-violations 20` passed;
- `python3 scripts/base2026-controller.py review-legacy-insights` reports `total_legacy_auto_public_cards=0`;
- live ay81 smoke found release marker, 1218 live documents, both new source records, and no empty-source state on the new source pages;
- live ay81 mixed visual QA passed with 66 checks and 0 failures.

Next step:

- rerun boundary/GitHub metadata checks, then stage/commit/push only public-safe code/docs/tooling changes.

## 2026-06-13 — ay82 source-dialog tooltip/caption hotfix and Actions-free GitHub

User reported two live source-dialog regressions: caption metadata looked cut when opened, and the info tooltip overflowed outside the modal. User also reported GitHub complaining about Actions on the free GitHub setup.

Actions taken:

- changed caption metadata disclosure copy to `Caption metadata snippet` when the source metadata is already truncated before import;
- removed nested caption metadata scroll/crop in the source dialog by allowing the caption preview body to expand normally;
- constrained `info-hint` tooltip width and added right-aligned tooltip positioning for modal-edge controls;
- removed `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/scorecard.yml`, and `.github/dependabot.yml`;
- updated `scripts/validate-github-metadata.py` so GitHub Actions workflows and Actions Dependabot config are explicitly disallowed for this public repo;
- updated `scripts/stage-public-files.ps1` so safe tracked deletions can be staged with the public staging helper;
- packaged/deployed data-preserving release `base2026-modal-caption-tooltip-ay82-20260613` with `-SkipReindex`.

Verification:

- `git diff --check` passed;
- `node --check web/static/meili.js` passed;
- `python3 scripts/validate-github-metadata.py` passed;
- `python3 scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py` passed with `forbidden=0`, `needs_review=0`, and `secret_findings=0`;
- `python3 scripts/check-public-export-policy.py public-data/tiktok` passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- `python3 scripts/validate-public-release-contract.py --export-dir public-data/tiktok` passed;
- live mobile browser QA at 390x844 confirmed no horizontal overflow, modal bounds inside viewport, caption metadata preview open with no internal cropping, and tooltip bounds inside both dialog and viewport;
- live desktop browser QA at 1159x863 confirmed the same tooltip/text geometry;
- full live visual QA passed: 66 checks, 0 failures; evidence under ignored `output/evidence/mobile-visual-qa-live-ay82-20260613/`.

Next step:

- stage, commit, and push public-safe code/docs/tooling changes only.

## 2026-06-13 — Source-detail search workspace redesign captured

User reported that the Base2026 search/source UX is conceptually broken: search keeps filters, the source modal is incomplete, source pages have more context but lose search, and duplicated actions (`Open source record` / `Source page`) force users to guess the correct path. User asked to restructure the work without a long token-heavy run, preserve SEO value, plan for future API/MCP consumption, and avoid publishing accidental full transcript dumps.

Actions taken:

- created `docs/project-memory/SOURCE_DETAIL_SEARCH_REDESIGN_2026_06_13.md` as the compact implementation contract;
- captured the product decision: one shared source-detail model, one `View source` action, no source modal as the primary reading path, persistent search/filter pane, and static source pages retained for SEO/sharing;
- separated `Source Excerpt` from `Platform Caption Metadata` and documented that full transcript/caption publication requires an explicit public data/policy change before UI exposure;
- added `UI-02` to `ACTIVE_QUEUE.md`;
- moved Public web UI back to `in_progress` in `STATUS_BOARD.csv` for this redesign pass;
- updated `NEXT_ACTION.md` so the next bounded pass starts with source-detail assembler/workspace work;
- recorded the durable decision in `DECISIONS.md`.

Verification:

- no code, deploy, intake, or git staging was performed;
- public/private boundary unchanged;
- generated public export artifacts were not touched.

Next step:

- implement `UI-02` in a bounded pass: shared source-detail assembler first, then search result action cleanup, desktop right-pane rendering, mobile no-modal detail state, static source-page SEO alignment, and visual/export QA before any deploy.

## 2026-06-13 — UI-02 local implementation pass

User told Codex to work from the captured source-detail plan.

Actions taken:

- added `#source-detail-panel` to the `/knowledge/` search workspace;
- changed search result actions to one primary `View source` action;
- added a client-side source-detail renderer in `web/static/meili.js`;
- source detail now loads the selected source record from `documents.jsonl`, then lazily loads related public passages and public insight cards from public JSONL data;
- source detail renders identity, actions, source excerpt, matched passage, related passages, public insight cards, topics, and source provenance without opening the old modal;
- mobile source detail uses `source-detail-open` with `Back to results` instead of a modal;
- static generated source pages now get a more explicit SEO title/description, `CreativeWork` plus `VideoObject` schema, and aligned sections: Source Excerpt, Related Passages, Public Insight Cards, Topics, and Source Provenance;
- kept full transcript publication blocked by existing public export policy. Platform caption metadata remains provenance, not a transcript.

Verification:

- `node --check web/static/meili.js` passed;
- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/generate-public-pages.py` passed;
- `git diff --check` passed;
- `python3 scripts/generate-public-pages.py --data public-data/tiktok --out output/tmp-ui02-pages` generated 1218 sources, 987 topics, 987 compare pages, and 4 creators;
- targeted generated source page check confirmed one H1, source-detail H2 sections, `Source Provenance`, `Platform Caption Metadata`, and `VideoObject` JSON-LD;
- local Playwright smoke on desktop 1360x900 and mobile 390x844 confirmed source detail opens in-page, `dialogOpen=false`, desktop keeps results visible, mobile hides results in detail state, and horizontal overflow is false;
- `python3 scripts/check-public-export-policy.py public-data/tiktok` passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- `python3 scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py` passed with `forbidden=0`, `needs_review=0`, and `secret_findings=0`.

Next step:

- package a UI-02 release and run full mixed visual QA before any deploy. Do not deploy, commit, or push unless explicitly requested.

## 2026-06-13 — ay83 source-detail workspace deployed after live modal mismatch

User reported that the live `/knowledge/` page still showed the old source modal and `Open source record` button after hard refresh. Root cause: UI-02 had been implemented locally but not deployed.

Actions taken:

- packaged data-preserving hotfix `base2026-source-detail-workspace-ay83-20260613` from current `public-data/tiktok`;
- preserved current public export membership/counts: 1218 source records, 1713 passages, 1607 insight cards, and 1034 public insight cards;
- deployed ay83 to VPS with `-SkipPackage -SkipReindex`;
- updated `scripts/mobile-visual-qa.mjs` so the source interaction gate checks `.view-source-detail` and `#source-detail-panel` instead of the removed primary modal path;
- updated project memory/runbook to make ay83 the current live release checkpoint.

Verification:

- package checks passed: public export policy, text excerpt validation, generated pages, sitemap generation;
- `python3 scripts/validate-public-release-contract.py --export-dir output/releases/base2026-source-detail-workspace-ay83-20260613/public-data/tiktok --baseline-export-dir public-data/tiktok --enforce-count-floor --max-violations 20` passed;
- `python3 scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py` passed with `forbidden=0`, `needs_review=0`, and `secret_findings=0`;
- `node --check output/releases/base2026-source-detail-workspace-ay83-20260613/web/static/meili.js` passed;
- deploy script confirmed nginx config OK and current symlink switched to `/var/www/base2026-knowledge/releases/base2026-source-detail-workspace-ay83-20260613`;
- live browser QA on desktop 1360x900 and mobile 390x844 confirmed asset version `base2026-source-detail-workspace-ay83-20260613`, `Open source record` buttons 0, result-level `Source page` buttons 0, `View source` buttons 20, source detail opens in-page, `dialogOpen=false`, desktop keeps results visible, mobile hides results in detail state, and horizontal overflow is false;
- targeted live visual QA passed: `node scripts/mobile-visual-qa.mjs --base-url https://aggressorbulkit.online --viewports full --only base-search-query --no-screenshots` produced 6 checks and 0 failures.

Next step:

- continue launch monitoring and pipeline hardening. For future full mixed visual QA, the source-detail gate now expects `.view-source-detail`/`#source-detail-panel`, not `.read-transcript`/`#transcript-dialog`.

## 2026-06-13 — Navigation architecture snapshot for external audit

User reviewed the ay83 live UI and rejected the current navigation architecture: desktop search looks like three narrow columns, matched passages are squeezed in the middle, source detail repeats identity and actions, creator/topic/source links eject users to standalone pages without search/filters, and the remaining modal-era code suggests the system still lacks a coherent IA. User asked for a complete `.md` snapshot of the project navigation, logic, dependencies, pipeline, page generation, desktop/mobile behavior, and current problems so another AI can audit the architecture before more UI work.

Actions taken:

- created `docs/project-memory/NAVIGATION_ARCHITECTURE_SNAPSHOT_2026_06_13.md`;
- documented the current live checkpoint, public data counts, public/private constraints, intake/export/static generation/search/deploy pipeline, JSONL model, Meilisearch runtime, generated page types, desktop/mobile layout behavior, route graph, duplicated renderers, legacy `#transcript-dialog` debt, and user-visible navigation failures;
- updated `NEXT_ACTION.md` so the next UI move is an architecture audit from the snapshot, not another narrow source-detail hotfix;
- corrected stale project-memory references that still treated ay82 as the live deploy in `DATA_SOURCES.md` and `STATUS_BOARD.csv`.

Verification:

- no deploy, reindex, intake automation, git staging, commit, or push was performed;
- no generated public data or private raw source files were edited;
- snapshot stays at architecture level and does not include raw private transcripts or credentials.

Next step:

- use `docs/project-memory/NAVIGATION_ARCHITECTURE_SNAPSHOT_2026_06_13.md` as the handoff input for an independent IA/navigation audit before changing the search/source/creator/topic UI again.

## 2026-06-13 — One-shot navigation recovery implemented locally

User supplied `/Users/alexyarosh/Downloads/BASE2026_ONESHOT_NAVIGATION_RECOVERY_PLAN_2026_06_13.md`, based on the navigation snapshot, and asked to use it as the recovery plan. The plan's core decision is that `/knowledge/` is the primary interactive search workspace, while generated static source/creator/topic/compare pages remain for SEO, canonical URLs, sitemap, sharing, and direct entry.

Actions taken:

- removed the legacy `dialog#transcript-dialog` DOM from both `web/static/meili.html` and `web/static/index.html`;
- removed the active `openTranscript()` runtime path and modal event listeners from `web/static/meili.js`;
- removed old `.transcript-dialog*`, scroll-lock, and orphan modal CSS rules from `web/static/styles.css`;
- added a lightweight query-param route-state layer in `web/static/meili.js` for `q`, `source`, `creator`, `topic`, `compare`, `year`, and `source_type`;
- changed direct `/knowledge/?source=...` hydration to open source detail in `#source-detail-panel`;
- changed `Back to results` to remove `source` from the URL and restore results on mobile;
- changed source-detail and result-card creator/topic links to stay inside the search workspace through `?creator=` and `?topic=` instead of ejecting users to static pages;
- changed source-detail action labels/hierarchy: `Search this creator`, `Open original`, `Source page`, `Correction / removal`; removed the user-facing `Canonical URL` action label;
- changed search result action label to `View source detail`;
- changed desktop layout from permanent three-column compression to two-column default, with third-column source detail only when `body.source-detail-open` is active on wide desktop;
- kept medium/mobile layouts from forcing three columns; mobile retains result/detail state switching;
- added `Open in Search Workspace` CTAs to generated source, creator, topic, and compare pages via `scripts/generate-public-pages.py`.

Verification:

- `node --check web/static/meili.js` passed;
- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/generate-public-pages.py` passed;
- `git diff --check` passed;
- `python3 scripts/check-public-export-policy.py public-data/tiktok` passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- `python3 scripts/validate-public-text-excerpts.py --data public-data/tiktok` passed with `checked=1217`;
- `python3 scripts/validate-public-release-contract.py --export-dir public-data/tiktok --baseline-export-dir public-data/tiktok --enforce-count-floor --max-violations 20` passed with 0 violations;
- `python3 scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py` passed with `forbidden=0`, `needs_review=0`, and `secret_findings=0`;
- `python3 scripts/generate-public-pages.py --data public-data/tiktok --out output/tmp-navigation-recovery-pages` generated 1218 source pages, 987 topic pages, 987 compare pages, and 4 creator pages;
- generated sample pages confirmed `Open in Search Workspace` CTAs while preserving canonical and robots metadata;
- local Playwright smoke in a temporary static `/knowledge/` sandbox confirmed direct `?source=tiktok-video-7650601606215372046` opens source detail, no `#transcript-dialog` exists, Source Excerpt/Related Passages/Public Insight Cards render, default desktop layout is two columns with detail hidden, selected-source desktop layout shows detail only while active, mobile `Back to results` removes `source` from the URL, restores results, hides detail, and has no horizontal overflow.

Not done:

- no deploy, reindex, intake automation, git staging, commit, or push was performed;
- full mixed live visual QA was not run because this pass stayed local and production deploy was not requested.

Next step:

- package this navigation recovery as a data-preserving UI release only after full mixed visual QA is run against the packaged artifact; keep Meilisearch reindex skipped unless public data changes.

## 2026-06-13 — Two-column workspace recovery implemented locally

User supplied `/Users/alexyarosh/Downloads/BASE2026_TWO_COLUMN_WORKSPACE_RECOVERY_2026_06_13.md` and clarified that the previous three-column recovery was wrong. The accepted contract is `filters | workspace`, where the right workspace shows either results or source detail, never both side by side.

Actions taken:

- removed the desktop `body.source-detail-open .meili-grid` three-column rule from `web/static/styles.css`;
- made `.meili-grid` a strict two-column layout: left filters and right active workspace;
- made `.source-detail-panel` hidden by default, grid-column 2, non-sticky, full-width, and visible only in `source-detail-open`;
- made `.results-panel` hidden whenever `source-detail-open` is active, including desktop/tablet;
- kept mobile one-column result/detail switching;
- added `knowledge-workspace-active` UI state for compact active search/source mode;
- fixed route-state cleanup so `Back to results` clears compact/source state when no query/filter remains;
- changed source-detail headings to use a readable public excerpt headline when platform title/caption metadata is truncated;
- changed result CTA label to `Open source record`;
- kept static SEO/share pages and `Open in Search Workspace` CTAs intact.

Verification:

- `node --check web/static/meili.js` passed;
- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/generate-public-pages.py` passed;
- `git diff --check` passed;
- targeted grep found no runtime `#transcript-dialog`, `openTranscript()`, `View source detail`, `Canonical URL`, or three-column source-detail grid rule;
- local Playwright smoke at `http://127.0.0.1:8788/` confirmed default desktop has two columns with results visible/detail hidden; `?source=tiktok-video-7650601606215372046` has two columns with results hidden/detail width 878px/Back visible; Back restores results and clears body class; mobile source detail is one column with no horizontal overflow;
- public export policy, text excerpt validation, public release contract, and publication boundary audit passed.

Not done:

- no deploy, reindex, intake automation, git staging, commit, or push was performed.

Next step:

- package and run full mixed visual QA for this two-column UI-only/data-preserving recovery before live deploy; skip Meilisearch reindex unless public data changes.

## 2026-06-14 — ay84 two-column workspace deployed

User asked to deploy the two-column `/knowledge/` workspace fix after confirming live ay83 still showed `filters | results | source detail` and the old placeholder panel.

Actions taken:

- confirmed live ay83 still loaded `base2026-source-detail-workspace-ay83-20260613`, contained the old `#transcript-dialog` / `openTranscript()` runtime path, and used a three-column CSS rule;
- fixed runtime source-detail JSONL hydration so related passages and public insight cards load from versioned `/knowledge/static/*.jsonl` instead of the `/knowledge/public-data/` route that returns HTML fallback on nginx;
- updated both public package paths to copy `documents.jsonl`, `passages.jsonl`, and `insight_cards.jsonl` into `web/static/`;
- packaged data-preserving hotfix `base2026-two-column-workspace-ay84-20260614` from the current public export;
- deployed ay84 to VPS with `-SkipPackage -SkipReindex`;
- updated project memory/runbook/status files so ay84 is the current live UI checkpoint and ay81 remains the data/reindex checkpoint.

Verification:

- preflight passed: `node --check web/static/meili.js`, PowerShell parser checks for package scripts, `git diff --check`, public export policy, public text excerpt validation, public release contract, and publication boundary audit;
- packaged artifact passed release contract, export policy, text excerpt validation, and local Playwright smoke;
- packaged smoke confirmed default desktop grid `280px 878px`, source-state grid `280px 878px`, results hidden/detail width 878px, `#transcript-dialog=false`, no horizontal overflow, and related passages loaded from static JSONL with no JSONL 404s;
- deploy script confirmed nginx config OK, nginx active, and current symlink switched to `/var/www/base2026-knowledge/releases/base2026-two-column-workspace-ay84-20260614`;
- live browser QA confirmed asset version `base2026-two-column-workspace-ay84-20260614`, default desktop results visible/detail hidden, `?source=tiktok-video-7650601606215372046` source detail replaces results, mobile source detail is one column, related passages load, JSONL failures are 0, and horizontal overflow is false;
- live HTTP checks confirmed `/knowledge/`, versioned `styles.css`, `meili.js`, `passages.jsonl`, `insight_cards.jsonl`, and `/knowledge-search/multi-search` return 200;
- targeted live visual QA passed: `node scripts/mobile-visual-qa.mjs --base-url https://aggressorbulkit.online --viewports full --only base-search-query --no-screenshots` produced 6 checks and 0 failures.

Not done:

- no Meilisearch reindex, intake automation, git staging, commit, or push was performed.

Next step:

- monitor live ay84 and continue pipeline hardening. Do not reintroduce a permanent third desktop column.

## 2026-06-14 — ay87 removed caption metadata snippet UI and processed current TikTok queue

User asked to remove the caption metadata snippet everywhere on desktop/mobile, deploy immediately, then check/process/upload new TikToks if available.

Actions taken:

- removed caption/platform metadata snippet rendering from runtime source detail, generated source pages, and CSS;
- fixed the leftover `isTruncatedCaption` reference that caused source-detail fallback in the first ay85 attempt;
- packaged and deployed clean UI hotfix ay86, then processed current TikTok intake and deployed final data release `base2026-public-hermes-ay87-20260614`;
- processed 2 queued 2026-06-13 caption-backed TikToks from `config/tiktok-intake-queue.local.json`;
- published/indexed `tiktok-video-7650935514643614998` from `@build_in_public`;
- held `tiktok-video-7650940529575775501` from `@tjrobertson52` as `needs_source_review` because transcript polish QA requires audio/source verification;
- updated builder/exporter guards so held/no-public-text rows do not publish empty source records.

Verification:

- public export policy, text excerpt validation, release contract, `kb-audit.py`, JS/Python syntax checks, and `git diff --check` passed;
- live symlink points to `/var/www/base2026-knowledge/releases/base2026-public-hermes-ay87-20260614`;
- Meilisearch reindexed 1714 passages;
- live DOM smoke confirmed asset version ay87, no `Caption metadata`, no `.caption-preview`, new source text visible, held source text absent, and no horizontal overflow on desktop/mobile;
- targeted live visual QA passed with 6 checks and 0 failures.

Not done:

- no git staging, commit, or push was performed.

## 2026-06-14 — ay88 local source-detail navigation simplification

User clarified that the remaining problem is not only the newest TikTok record: the current Base2026 source navigation is generally overloaded, duplicated, and confusing across desktop/mobile. They asked to structure the work, research, and continue without turning this into another disconnected page/modal system.

Actions taken:

- simplified runtime `/knowledge/?source=` source detail so provenance lives in compact top metadata chips instead of bottom cards;
- removed runtime empty public insight-card rendering when a source has no linked insight cards;
- simplified generated static source pages by removing bottom `Source Provenance`, duplicate `Topics`, source-policy note cards, and empty related/insight fallback sections;
- changed generated static source `Creator page` navigation to workspace route-state (`../index.html?creator=...`) and kept SEO pages as direct-entry/support pages;
- decoded HTML entities before rendering source excerpts/passages so `don&#39;t`/`It&#39;s` no longer appears as raw entity text;
- adjusted mobile source-state layout so the hero/stat block is hidden and the mobile filter bar is not sticky over source detail text;
- removed unused `source-provenance-list` CSS so the old provenance-card UI is not preserved as dormant styling.

Verification:

- `node --check web/static/meili.js` passed;
- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/generate-public-pages.py` passed;
- `git diff --check -- scripts/generate-public-pages.py web/static/meili.js web/static/styles.css` passed;
- packaged local data-preserving hotfix `base2026-nav-simplify-ay88-20260614`;
- packaging checks passed: public export policy, public text excerpt validation, and sitemap generation;
- targeted grep on the packaged release found no `Source Provenance`, `source-provenance-list`, caption metadata, empty source insight fallback, or raw `&#39;` strings in source HTML/JS;
- local Playwright DOM QA passed for workspace mobile source, static mobile source, and workspace desktop source: no source provenance, no caption metadata, no empty insight fallback, no raw HTML entities, decoded apostrophes visible, no horizontal overflow, and mobile source-state filter bar is static.
- publication boundary audit passed: 21 changed files, 0 forbidden files, 0 secret findings, and all changed files reported as public-safe candidates.

Not done:

- no deploy, Meilisearch reindex, intake automation, git staging, commit, or push was performed.

## 2026-06-14 — ay88 source-detail simplification deployed

User asked to continue instead of stopping at the local ay88 package.

Actions taken:

- deployed `base2026-nav-simplify-ay88-20260614` with `scripts/deploy-public-vps.ps1 -SkipPackage -SkipReindex`;
- switched `/var/www/base2026-knowledge/current` to `/var/www/base2026-knowledge/releases/base2026-nav-simplify-ay88-20260614`;
- kept Meilisearch on the ay87 1714-passage data/reindex checkpoint because ay88 is a data-preserving UI/static-page hotfix;
- verified live `/knowledge/` and the static source page load ay88 asset cache-busts;
- verified live source detail on mobile and desktop with Playwright DOM QA.

Verification:

- deploy script passed nginx config test, nginx reload, symlink verify, and remote file checks;
- live curl confirmed `/knowledge/` and `/knowledge/sources/tiktok-video-7650935514643614998.html` reference `base2026-nav-simplify-ay88-20260614`;
- live Playwright DOM QA passed for workspace mobile source, workspace desktop source, and static mobile source: no `Source Provenance`, no caption metadata, no empty source insight fallback, no raw `&#39;`, decoded apostrophes visible, source detail replaces results in workspace state, filter bar is static on mobile, and horizontal overflow is false;
- targeted live visual QA passed: `node scripts/mobile-visual-qa.mjs --base-url https://aggressorbulkit.online --viewports full --only base-search-query --no-screenshots` returned 6 checks and 0 failures.

Not done:

- no Meilisearch reindex, intake automation, git staging, commit, or push was performed.

## 2026-06-14 — ay89 insight-first source detail deployed

User clarified that the deeper problem is product architecture/value: Base2026 should not become a raw TikTok transcription mirror where the same video text appears as title, hero, excerpt, matched passage, related passage, and provenance. They asked to rethink the product as source-backed intelligence and deploy after tests.

Actions taken:

- changed runtime `/knowledge/?source=` source detail to render `Source Intelligence` first when linked public insight cards exist;
- changed runtime source detail to render one short `Evidence Excerpt` and dedupe matched/additional evidence against the primary source text;
- changed no-insight runtime source detail headings to neutral `Source record from @handle` instead of transcript-derived headings;
- shortened search result snippets so result cards do not display long transcript-like blocks;
- changed generated static source pages to use the same insight-first/evidence-once contract;
- kept static pages for SEO/sharing and `/knowledge/` as the interactive source workspace;
- updated `scripts/mobile-visual-qa.mjs` so `base-search-query` validates the current source-workspace flow instead of expecting the removed legacy modal;
- packaged and deployed `base2026-insight-first-ay89-20260614` with `-SkipPackage -SkipReindex` after local packaging.

Verification:

- `node --check web/static/meili.js` passed;
- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/generate-public-pages.py` passed;
- `git diff --check -- scripts/generate-public-pages.py web/static/meili.js web/static/styles.css` passed;
- local package checks passed: public export policy, public text excerpt validation, generated pages, and sitemap generation;
- local Playwright QA passed for static no-insight mobile source, workspace no-insight mobile source, and static insight desktop source: old labels absent, `Evidence Excerpt` present, repeated problematic source phrase count is 1, and no mobile overflow;
- deploy script passed nginx config test, symlink switch, and active release verification;
- live curl confirmed `/knowledge/` loads `base2026-insight-first-ay89-20260614` assets and the checked source page contains `Evidence Excerpt` with none of the old labels;
- live Playwright QA passed for static no-insight mobile source, workspace no-insight mobile source, and static insight desktop source: no `Source Provenance`, no `Caption Metadata Snippet`, no `Related Passages`, no `Matched Passage`, no `Public Insight Cards`, no mobile overflow, and repeated problematic source phrase count is 1;
- first targeted visual QA failed because the test still expected the removed source modal; after updating the script to source-workspace expectations, targeted live visual QA passed with 6 checks and 0 failures.

Not done:

- no Meilisearch reindex, intake automation, git staging, commit, or push was performed.

## 2026-06-14 — ay89 post-deploy TikTok intake check

User had also asked to check for new TikToks and process/upload them if safe.

Actions taken:

- ran `scripts/hermes-tiktok-refresh.ps1 -CheckOnly -PlaylistEnd 50`;
- found 1 new 2026-06-14 `@joshuamaraney` source: `tiktok-video-7651218412475059464`;
- ran the small caption-first intake path with `-TranscriptLimit 5 -SkipAsr -PolishLimit 5 -BatchSize 5 -BatchSet ay89-josh-new-20260614`;
- caption extraction succeeded for the new source and created one polish batch;
- created faithful local polish/QA artifacts for the new source;
- marked the source as `needs_source_review` in local `videos.csv` instead of public release.

Verification:

- after the intake pass, check-only summary is `total=3020`, `active=1221`, `queued_transcript=0`, `needs_asr=0`, `transcribed=1218`, `needs_polish=0`;
- batch-scoped polish status no longer reports the held source as publishable/transcribed because it is now `needs_source_review`.

Not done:

- the new source was not packaged, indexed, deployed, or promoted to public export because the captions contain high-risk current-event/entity claims about Anthropic/Claude/Fable/security intervention that need audio/source verification.
- no git staging, commit, or push was performed.

## 2026-06-14 — operator-approved new Josh source deployed

User confirmed the new `@joshuamaraney` source information is verified and asked to deploy it.

Actions taken:

- treated the user confirmation as source-review approval for `tiktok-video-7651218412475059464`;
- changed the local video row from `needs_source_review` to `transcribed`;
- changed the polish QA JSON from `needs_review` to `pass`;
- reran the batch-scoped `AfterPolish` pipeline with `-Package`;
- rebuilt SQLite and exported public TikTok data;
- packaged `base2026-public-hermes-20260614-060556`;
- deployed with `scripts/deploy-public-vps.ps1 -ReleaseName base2026-public-hermes-20260614-060556 -SkipPackage`;
- reindexed Meilisearch with 1715 passages.

Verification:

- batch polish status passed with `needs_review=0`;
- `kb-audit.py` passed;
- public export policy passed: 1219 source records, 1715 passages, 1607 insight cards, 1034 public insight cards, 987 public topics;
- public release contract passed with 0 violations;
- deploy script passed nginx config checks and switched current symlink to `/var/www/base2026-knowledge/releases/base2026-public-hermes-20260614-060556`;
- live source page `/knowledge/sources/tiktok-video-7651218412475059464.html` returns 200 and contains `Evidence Excerpt`;
- live search for `Claude Fable` includes `tiktok-video-7651218412475059464`;
- live browser QA passed on mobile/desktop static source and mobile workspace source: no legacy source-detail markers, checked phrase repeats once, mobile overflow false;
- targeted live visual QA passed with 6 checks and 0 failures.

Not done:

- no insight cards were generated/promoted for this source in this pass;
- no git staging, commit, or push was performed.

## 2026-06-14 — product passport correction for source-text database

User clarified the original Base2026 product idea: the pipeline is good, and the core value is a searchable text database built from creator-video transcripts. Public pages should not be raw scraped caption dumps, but selected source records should expose reviewed polished public source text/transcript with Base2026-authored explanations, topics, insight cards, attribution, original links, methodology, and correction/removal controls. Arbitrary truncation and repeated excerpt/matched/related blocks break the product.

Actions taken:

- added `docs/project-memory/BASE2026_PRODUCT_PASSPORT_2026_06_14.md` with the corrected product contract;
- updated `DECISIONS.md` to supersede strict excerpt-only as final architecture and allow reviewed public source text where policy allows;
- updated `PUBLICATION_BOUNDARY.md` to distinguish raw/unreviewed transcript dumps from reviewed public source text;
- updated `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `ACTIVE_PHASE.md`, `NEXT_ACTION.md`, `DATA_SOURCES.md`, and `STATUS_BOARD.csv` so future implementation starts from the database/source-text contract instead of optimizing cropped Evidence Excerpt pages.
- updated `README.md`, `OPEN_SOURCE_POSITIONING.md`, `PUBLIC_INTELLIGENCE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_2026_06_08.md`, `ATTRIBUTED_INTELLIGENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md`, `CURRENT_ROADMAP.md`, and `NAVIGATION_ARCHITECTURE_SNAPSHOT_2026_06_13.md` so old excerpt-only language is marked as historical safety state rather than final product direction.
- refined the product passport after the operator clarified the original UX: Base2026 should behave like a Google-style search engine over creator-video source records. Result previews stay short; a selected result opens the full normalized public transcript/source text plus short and fuller Base2026-authored explanations and related topics.

Not done:

- no runtime/export code was changed in this documentation pass;
- no deploy, git staging, commit, or push was performed.

## 2026-06-14 — local source-text implementation pass

User asked to bring the project to the newly clarified model: Google-like search results, selected result opens a full source record, normalized transcript/source text is present as the database layer, and short/full Base2026-authored explanations explain the video without turning the product into a raw transcript dump.

Actions taken:

- changed `scripts/export-public-tiktok.py` to add `public_source_text`, `public_source_text_available`, `source_summary_short`, and `source_summary_long` to every public source record;
- kept legacy `transcript` empty and `include_full_transcripts=false`, so the old raw/full-transcript release path remains blocked;
- changed `scripts/generate-public-pages.py` so static source pages render `Source Text` from reviewed public source text instead of a cropped `Evidence Excerpt`;
- changed `web/static/meili.js` so runtime `/knowledge/?source=` renders the same `Source Text` contract, highlights query terms in the full source text, and keeps search result cards as short previews with one `View source` action;
- changed `web/static/styles.css` for readable source text and source summary spacing;
- changed `scripts/mobile-visual-qa.mjs` so QA expects `Source Text` instead of the removed `Evidence Excerpt`;
- updated `contracts/base2026.public-release-contract.json` to allow reviewed public source text while keeping `-IncludeFullTranscripts` blocked for public deploys;
- rebuilt local public export and static pages;
- packaged local release `base2026-source-text-local-20260614` without deploying.

Verification:

- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/export-public-tiktok.py scripts/generate-public-pages.py scripts/check-public-export-policy.py scripts/validate-public-release-contract.py` passed;
- `node --check web/static/meili.js` and `node --check scripts/mobile-visual-qa.mjs` passed;
- `git diff --check` passed for changed export/page/runtime/CSS/QA/contract files;
- `python3 scripts/export-public-tiktok.py` exported 1219 source records, 1715 passages, 1607 insight cards, 1034 public insight cards;
- `python3 scripts/check-public-export-policy.py public-data/tiktok` passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- all 1219 source records have `public_source_text`; 0 source records have non-empty legacy `transcript`;
- checked source `tiktok-video-7651218412475059464` has `public_source_text_len=1058`, `transcript_len=0`, and summary fields;
- `python3 scripts/generate-public-pages.py --data public-data/tiktok --out web/static` generated 1219 source pages and 987 topic pages;
- `pwsh ./scripts/package-public-release.ps1 -ReleaseName base2026-source-text-local-20260614` passed export policy, text excerpt validation, release contract, page generation, and sitemap generation;
- local packaged source page and runtime `/index.html?source=tiktok-video-7651218412475059464` were checked with Playwright on desktop and mobile: `Source Text` present, `Evidence Excerpt` absent, `Caption Metadata` absent, `Source Provenance` absent, horizontal overflow false, legacy dialog false.

Not done:

- no VPS deploy, Meilisearch reindex, git staging, commit, or push was performed.

## 2026-06-14 — deployed source-text record UX

User asked to deploy the source-text implementation live and verify it on production.

Actions taken:

- deployed existing package `base2026-source-text-local-20260614` with `scripts/deploy-public-vps.ps1 -ReleaseName base2026-source-text-local-20260614 -SkipPackage -SkipReindex`;
- nginx config test passed before and after symlink switch;
- current symlink now points to `/var/www/base2026-knowledge/releases/base2026-source-text-local-20260614`;
- skipped Meilisearch reindex because passage bodies/index settings did not change; source detail reads the new source text from versioned static `documents.jsonl`.

Verification:

- live static source page `/knowledge/sources/tiktok-video-7651218412475059464.html` contains `Source Text`, does not contain `Evidence Excerpt`, `Caption Metadata Snippet`, or `Source Provenance`, and loads `base2026-source-text-local-20260614` assets;
- live `/knowledge/static/documents.jsonl?v=base2026-source-text-local-20260614` has 1219 records, 0 missing `public_source_text`, and 0 non-empty legacy `transcript` fields;
- live static asset headers for `meili.js` and `styles.css` return 200 with gzip, `Vary: Accept-Encoding`, and immutable cache headers;
- live Playwright checks passed on desktop/mobile static source page: `Source Text=true`, `Evidence Excerpt=false`, caption/provenance false, overflow false;
- live Playwright checks passed on desktop/mobile runtime `/knowledge/?source=tiktok-video-7651218412475059464`: `Source Text=true`, `Evidence Excerpt=false`, legacy dialog false, overflow false;
- live mobile search-click flow for `?q=Claude Fable` shows `View source`, opens source detail with `Source Text`, no legacy modal, and no horizontal overflow;
- targeted live visual QA passed: `node scripts/mobile-visual-qa.mjs --base-url https://aggressorbulkit.online --viewports mobile --only base-search-query --no-screenshots` returned 4 results and 0 failures.

Not done:

- no git staging, commit, or push was performed.

## 2026-06-14 — Source Intelligence full-text hotfix

User reported that after searching by keyword and opening `View source`, the `Source Intelligence` card still showed clipped text ending in `...`.

Root cause:

- the visible cut was not CSS clipping;
- many public `insight_cards.jsonl` rows store `evidence_excerpt` as an intentionally shortened excerpt;
- the full reviewed public passage is already available in `passages.jsonl` for the same source.

Actions taken:

- changed runtime `web/static/meili.js` so source-detail `Source Intelligence` expands clipped insight evidence from the same-source public passage before rendering;
- changed `scripts/generate-public-pages.py` so generated static source pages use a source-specific insight-card renderer instead of the generic compact card path;
- packaged data-preserving release `base2026-source-intel-fulltext-20260614`;
- deployed the release with `scripts/deploy-public-vps.ps1 -SkipPackage -SkipReindex`.

Verification:

- `node --check web/static/meili.js` passed;
- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/generate-public-pages.py` passed;
- local generated page for `tiktok-video-7644200324382625026` contains the continuation after `I am gonna show you now.` and no `I am gonna show you now...`;
- public release contract passed with 0 violations;
- live static source page and live `/knowledge/?q=keyword&source=tiktok-video-7644200324382625026` both load `base2026-source-intel-fulltext-20260614` assets, contain `Source Intelligence`, do not contain the bad `now...` truncation, and include the full passage ending;
- live mobile workspace source state has no horizontal overflow and no console/page errors.

Not done:

- no Meilisearch reindex was run because passage bodies and index settings did not change;
- no git staging, commit, or push was performed.

## 2026-06-14 — WordPress + Base2026 SEO/GEO architecture docs

User asked for a strategic plan to maximize SEO/GEO/AI visibility for both the WordPress commercial site and the Base2026 knowledge product, plus a separate Base2026 project passport file for commercial brief/audit use.

Actions taken:

- reviewed the current Base2026 product passport, project memory, public JSONL counts, and SEO/schema/search architecture references;
- used the SEO, AI SEO, GEO command-center, programmatic SEO, schema, and site architecture skill frameworks;
- created `docs/project-memory/BASE2026_COMMERCIAL_PROJECT_PASSPORT_2026_06_14.md`;
- created `docs/project-memory/SEO_GEO_GROWTH_PLAN_2026_06_14.md`;
- updated `docs/project-memory/NEXT_ACTION.md` so the new docs become the current operating context for the next SEO/GEO implementation pass.

Key conclusions:

- WordPress should be treated as the commercial/entity/conversion layer;
- Base2026 should be treated as the public evidence/source-intelligence layer;
- new Base2026 content needs an automatic SEO/GEO enrichment step before static generation and deploy;
- static pages remain valuable for canonical URLs, sitemap, sharing, and crawlable records, but `/knowledge/` remains the primary interactive search workspace;
- avoid raw transcript dumps and thin programmatic SEO pages; the public value must be reviewed source text plus Base2026-authored summaries, topics, insight cards, attribution, and correction/removal paths.

Verification:

- confirmed current local public export counts: 1,219 source records, 1,715 passages, 1,607 insight cards, 1,034 public insight cards, 1,504 topics, and 4 creators;
- docs only, no code/package/deploy changes;
- no private raw captions, ASR, media, local DBs, logs, credentials, or generated release archives were added.

Not done:

- no implementation of `llms.txt`, SEO fields, topic scoring, schema changes, deploy, git staging, commit, or push was performed.

## 2026-06-14 — Signal Maps / visual SEO one-shot implementation and deploy

User provided `BASE2026_CODEX_55_ONESHOT_SIGNAL_VISUAL_SEO_PROMPT_2026_06_14.md` requesting a coordinated production pass: compact visual polish, deterministic Signal Maps / Topic Signal Briefs, Base2026 SEO/GEO/readability groundwork, API/MCP public contract planning, full QA, and live deploy without changing the ingestion pipeline or public/private boundary.

Actions taken:

- added deterministic `scripts/generate-topic-signal-briefs.py`;
- generated current public `topic_signal_briefs.jsonl` with 2 strong topics: `internal-linking` and `on-page-seo`;
- added compact Signal Maps strip and manifest-derived counters to `/knowledge/`;
- added runtime search-signal hint when a real query/filter has enough visible source/creator support;
- added compact `Topic Signal Brief` rendering to static strong topic pages only;
- added `/knowledge/llms.txt`, root `/llms.txt` packaging support, `/knowledge/data-dictionary.json`, and `/knowledge/api-index.json`;
- added `docs/project-memory/BASE2026_API_MCP_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_PLAN.md`;
- updated `docs/schemas/PUBLIC_JSONL_SCHEMA.md`, `docs/project-memory/DECISIONS.md`, `scripts/package-public-release.ps1`, `scripts/deploy-public-vps.ps1`, and `scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py`;
- packaged and deployed `base2026-signal-visual-seo-20260614`;
- skipped Meilisearch reindex because passage/index data did not change.

Verification:

- `python3 -m py_compile` passed for the changed/gated Python scripts;
- `node --check web/static/meili.js` and `node --check scripts/mobile-visual-qa.mjs` passed;
- `git diff --check` passed;
- `check-public-export-policy`, `validate-public-text-excerpts`, `validate-public-release-contract`, `audit-publication-boundary`, and `validate-github-metadata` passed;
- package release produced 1,219 documents, 1,715 chunks, 987 public topics, 1,304 sitemap URLs, and 2 signal briefs;
- live smoke confirmed the release marker, signal strip, strong topic signal pages, no signal brief on a weak topic, `/llms.txt`, `/knowledge/llms.txt`, `/knowledge/data-dictionary.json`, and `/knowledge/api-index.json`;
- live mobile visual QA for `base-search-query` passed with 4 checks and 0 failures;
- live targeted DOM checks passed with 16 checks and 0 failures.

Not done:

- no TikTok intake was run;
- no Meilisearch reindex was run;

## 2026-06-14 — Base2026 analytics / Geist / compact navigation deploy

User asked to make the Base2026 search workspace more compact and understandable, use Vercel Geist, avoid button proliferation, add a public analytics layer/counts, and keep the TikTok intake pipeline in a separate dedicated thread.

Actions taken:

- created a separate Codex intake thread for TikTok URL pipeline work: `019ec83b-e8d1-74e0-bfa4-f5949edd63c6`;
- added `scripts/generate-public-analytics.py`, a deterministic public JSONL-only analytics summary generator;
- wired normal package/deploy checks to generate and verify `analytics_summary.json`;
- switched `/knowledge/` runtime analytics loading to `analytics_summary.json` with `base2026_analytics.json` as fallback;
- added compact analytics strip/result-card count support from public topic/creator aggregates;
- changed Base2026 generated headers to permanent product nav: Search, Analytics, Topics, Creators, Methodology, then separated WordPress links;
- removed the duplicate workspace product-nav strip from search HTML;
- tightened Geist/Geist Mono typography and compact dataset stat styling in `web/static/styles.css`;
- fixed `/knowledge/analytics.html` root-level asset paths so it loads `/knowledge/static/styles.css`;
- packaged and deployed `base2026-analytics-geist-20260614`;
- skipped Meilisearch reindex because passage bodies/index settings did not change.

Verification:

- `python3 -m py_compile` passed for changed generator/audit scripts;
- `node --check` passed for the release `meili.js`;
- public export policy, text excerpt validation, public release contract, and publication-boundary audit passed;
- package release produced 1,219 documents, 1,715 chunks, 987 public topics, 1,305 sitemap URLs, 2 signal briefs, and analytics JSON;
- live `/knowledge/` smoke confirmed release CSS/JS markers, Geist, `analytics_summary.json`, no duplicate product-nav HTML, and `/knowledge/analytics.html`;
- live Playwright search/source QA passed on desktop and mobile with no overflow, analytics strip visible, result-card analytics chips present, only `Open source` CTAs, no legacy modal, source detail open in workspace, `Source Text` visible, and no `Caption Metadata` or `Source Provenance`;
- live Playwright analytics-page QA passed on desktop and mobile with Geist loaded from `/knowledge/static/styles.css`, 4 stat cards, 24 topic ranking rows, 4 creator cards, no overflow, and no console errors.

Not done:

- no new TikTok intake was run in this thread;
- no Meilisearch reindex was run;
- no git staging, commit, or push was performed.

## 2026-06-15 — Base2026 content-pipeline/source-detail fix

User reported that new TikToks were publishing as plain text without Source Intelligence and older source records repeated the same transcript/source text in several blocks. User asked for investigation, root cause, fix, deploy, and live verification.

Actions taken:

- confirmed root causes in data and UI:
  - source detail expanded clipped insight evidence back into the full source text, duplicating the visible Source Text;
  - static source pages rendered the same expanded evidence inside insight cards;
  - new source records could pass public export with source text but no topics/public insight cards;
  - `export-public-tiktok.py` ignored reviewed `claim_evidence.quote_or_span`, so approved manual candidates could fail public insight promotion;
- changed runtime `/knowledge/?source=` to show full source text once, collapse source evidence in Source Intelligence by default, show claim/action as the value layer, and restore source share/copy/print actions;
- changed generated source pages to use the same source-detail contract;
- changed `export-public-tiktok.py` to respect reviewed evidence spans when present in chunks;
- added `scripts/check-public-content-readiness.py` and wired normal/hotfix package paths to block the newest source-only record with no topic/public insight layer;
- added 7 approved reviewed candidate rows to the ignored local replay archive for the latest source-only problem records;
- rebuilt SQLite, exported public data, regenerated public pages/analytics/topic signal briefs, packaged, deployed, and reindexed Meilisearch as `base2026-content-pipeline-fix-20260615`.

Verification:

- JSONL replay archive validated;
- `build-kb-sqlite.py` completed with 92 reviewed candidate rows;
- public export produced 1219 source records, 1715 passages, 1614 insight cards, 1043 public insight cards, 1510 topics, and 995 public topics;
- public policy, public text excerpt validation, public release contract, and content-readiness checks passed;
- live static JSONL confirmed public insights/topics for `tiktok-video-7651218412475059464`, `tiktok-video-7650481268206931222`, and `tiktok-video-7650601606215372046`;
- live static source page confirmed Source Intelligence and share actions are present, while Caption Metadata and Source Provenance are absent;
- live Playwright desktop/mobile QA passed on three source-state URLs with no console/page errors, no modal, no horizontal overflow, Source Text and Source Intelligence present, 4 share actions, and collapsed evidence details.

Not done:

- no git staging, commit, or push was performed;
- historical source-only/low-value backlog was not bulk auto-approved; future pipeline work should run extraction/review before deploy rather than manually recovering after publication.

## 2026-06-15 — Base2026 analytics/topic routing and Source Intelligence grouping fix

User reported that `/topics/on-page-seo.html` was empty/404 from analytics navigation, `/knowledge/analytics.html` looked good but linked into missing pages, result-card analytics chips visually collided with `Open source`, and Source Intelligence showed near-duplicate blocks for the same TikTok. User asked to fix the project to production level, deploy, and verify live.

Actions taken:

- confirmed `/topics/on-page-seo.html` returned WordPress 404 while `/knowledge/topics/on-page-seo.html` was a populated generated topic page;
- fixed `scripts/generate-public-pages.py` so `/knowledge/analytics.html` uses same-directory links (`./topics/...`, `./index.html?...`) instead of root-escaping `../...` links;
- added nginx canonical redirects for legacy/root Base2026 generated paths: `/topics/`, `/sources/`, `/creators/`, and `/compare/` now redirect under `/knowledge/`;
- changed runtime source detail and generated static source pages to group closely related Source Intelligence rows from the same source into one card with compact related-topic chips, compact action text, and collapsed evidence;
- removed the repeated large `Search this topic` CTA from Source Intelligence cards; topic navigation now lives in the topic chips;
- added result-card spacing between analytics chips and the `Open source` action;
- regenerated static public pages, packaged, deployed, and reindexed Meilisearch as `base2026-topic-analytics-intel-fix-20260615`;
- applied and reloaded the nginx redirect patch on the VPS after deploy.

Verification:

- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/generate-public-pages.py scripts/server-patch-nginx-base2026.py` passed;
- `node --check web/static/meili.js` passed;
- `git diff --check` passed;
- public export policy, public text excerpt validation, and public release contract passed;
- deploy completed with 1219 source records, 1715 passages, 1614 insight cards, 1043 public insight cards, 1510 topics, 995 public topics, and Meilisearch reindexed 1715 passages;
- live curl confirmed `/topics/on-page-seo.html` returns 301 to `/knowledge/topics/on-page-seo.html` and then 200;
- live analytics HTML confirmed topic links resolve as `/knowledge/topics/...`;
- live static source page confirmed `tiktok-video-7651218412475059464` renders one grouped `2 related signals · AI Model Governance / AI Security Risk` block;
- live Playwright desktop/mobile checks passed with no console/page errors, no horizontal overflow on mobile, 1 Source Intelligence card, 2 topic chips, 4 share actions, no `Search this topic` text, and 12px result-card spacing.

Not done:

- no new TikTok intake was run;
- no git staging, commit, or push was performed.

## 2026-06-15 — Base2026 source page hero/evidence polish

User reported that the generated source page for `tiktok-video-7640117982898752790` had two TikTok icons, a wrapped `Correction or opt-out` hero button, and a confusing `Additional Evidence` block that was only a tail fragment of the same Source Text.

Actions taken:

- confirmed the data shape: the source has full reviewed public source text plus two passage chunks, where the second chunk is a substring/tail of the same Source Text;
- changed `scripts/generate-public-pages.py` so source identity does not render the platform icon for source pages;
- removed source-record hero `Correction or opt-out` from generated source pages;
- added a fragment-containment guard so passage chunks already contained in Source Text do not render as separate evidence blocks;
- changed `web/static/meili.js` to apply the same runtime source-detail rules;
- removed the runtime source-detail `Correction / removal` hero action;
- renamed the distinct-context fallback from `Additional Evidence` to `Supporting Passages`;
- adjusted mobile source hero action CSS so the remaining actions are not hidden by the previous third-button suppression rule;
- regenerated static pages, deployed, and reindexed as `base2026-source-page-polish-20260615`.

Verification:

- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/generate-public-pages.py` passed;
- `node --check web/static/meili.js` passed;
- `git diff --check` passed for changed source files;
- `check-public-export-policy`, `validate-public-text-excerpts`, and `validate-public-release-contract` passed;
- local generated source page smoke confirmed 0 platform icons in source identity, 1 platform icon in compact metadata, hero buttons `Open in Search Workspace`, `Open original`, `Creator`, no hero correction action, and no `Additional Evidence`/tail fragment;
- deploy completed with 1219 source records, 1715 passages, 1614 insight cards, 1043 public insight cards, 1510 topics, 995 public topics, and Meilisearch reindexed 1715 passages;
- live source page smoke confirmed the same checks on `https://aggressorbulkit.online/knowledge/sources/tiktok-video-7640117982898752790.html`;
- live runtime asset smoke confirmed `static/meili.js?v=base2026-source-page-polish-20260615` contains the fragment guard and no runtime `Additional Evidence` label or source-detail correction action.

Not done:

- Playwright was not run in this repo because the local project does not currently have Playwright installed in `node_modules`;
- no new TikTok intake was run.
## 2026-06-15 — Base2026 info-page, roadmap, support, and footer polish

User asked to align public Methodology, Source & Content Policy, Creator Correction/Removal, Project Story, and Roadmap copy with the corrected Base2026 product passport; make roadmap milestone badges smaller and inline; verify roadmap statuses against actual project state; add support/contact forms to support and roadmap pages; unify the Base2026 footer with the WordPress/global footer CTA set; deploy immediately; and record GitHub repo/Page/Project cleanup as a separate next task.

Actions taken:

- updated public docs under `docs/public-pages/` so they distinguish private raw captions/ASR/media/private QA from reviewed public source text that may appear on source records when policy allows;
- corrected roadmap status language: search/source pages, Source Intelligence, analytics, topic/source pages, and public database counters are live; TikTok intake handoff, evidence-gated review, historical transcript QA/source-review debt, creator claims, visitor/search analytics, API/MCP access, and monetization remain in progress/planned/research;
- changed `web/static/roadmap.js` so milestone cards render `title | status` through `milestone-card__head`;
- added a static contact form to generated roadmap/support pages through `scripts/generate-info-pages.py`, using `offflinerpsy@gmail.com`;
- added the third footer CTA `Base2026` to both info-page and generated source/topic/creator page shells;
- added CSS for compact milestone status rows, Base2026 footer CTA, and the support/roadmap contact form;
- regenerated info pages and generated public pages;
- deployed `base2026-info-pages-polish-20260615` with the normal VPS deploy script and reindexed Meilisearch;
- updated project memory and queued GitHub repo presentation cleanup as the next separate workstream.

Verification:

- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/generate-info-pages.py scripts/generate-public-pages.py` passed;
- `node --check web/static/roadmap.js` passed;
- `python3 scripts/check-public-export-policy.py public-data/tiktok` passed;
- `python3 scripts/validate-public-text-excerpts.py --data public-data/tiktok` passed;
- `python3 scripts/validate-public-release-contract.py --export-dir public-data/tiktok --baseline-export-dir public-data/tiktok` passed;
- `git diff --check` passed for the edited source/docs files;
- deploy completed with 1219 source records, 1715 passages, 1614 insight cards, 1043 public insight cards, 1510 topics, 995 public topics, and Meilisearch indexed 1715 passages;
- live smoke confirmed 200 responses for `/knowledge/roadmap.html`, `/knowledge/support.html`, and `/knowledge/sources/tiktok-video-7640117982898752790.html`;
- live smoke confirmed release marker `base2026-info-pages-polish-20260615`, roadmap/support contact sections, footer `Base2026` CTA on both info and source pages, updated methodology/source-policy/opt-out text, and live roadmap JS strings including `milestone-card__head`.

Not done:

- Playwright/browser screenshot QA was not run because the repo has no local `node_modules` and no Playwright package installed;
- GitHub repo/Page/Project cleanup was not started in this pass and is intentionally queued as the next separate workstream.

## 2026-06-15 — Base2026 footer/contact/API polish, WordPress plan context, and live deploy

User asked to make the Base2026 contact form block use the main orange brand color, unify oversized footer CTAs, verify that paid pricing buttons preserve selected package context on the WordPress audit form, add a simple AI/API access surface for Base2026, push the public-safe project state toward GitHub, and deploy.

Actions taken:

- changed Base2026 footer CTAs from large uneven cards to compact same-row actions matching the main-site footer rhythm;
- changed Base2026 support/roadmap contact copy block to an orange brand panel while keeping the form readable;
- added `/knowledge/api.html`, `api-index.json` metadata, `llms.txt` references, README copy, and release-script checks for public read-only AI/API access;
- added a public GitHub Pages landing page under `docs/index.html`;
- added a WordPress Novamira sandbox snippet that reads pricing `?plan=` context on `/ai-visibility-audit/`, displays the selected package, writes it into a hidden field, and prepends it to submitted notes before the existing email handler runs;
- confirmed WordPress audit/snapshot submissions use `AY_CONTACT_EMAIL`, currently `offflinerpsy@gmail.com`;
- regenerated Base2026 info pages and deployed `base2026-footer-api-pricing-context-r2-20260615`.

Verification:

- public release packaged and deployed with 1219 source records, 1715 passages, 1614 insight cards, 1043 public insight cards, 1510 topics, 995 public topics, and 1308 sitemap URLs;
- Meilisearch reindexed 1715 passages;
- live `/knowledge/api.html`, `/knowledge/api-index.json`, `/knowledge/llms.txt`, `/knowledge/roadmap.html`, and `/knowledge-search/multi-search` smoke checks passed;
- live CSS contains the compact footer and orange contact block changes;
- live WordPress audit page with `?plan=sprint` contains the selected-package client code and footer mail target `offflinerpsy@gmail.com`;
- no robots/noindex/canonical code path was changed; `/knowledge/api.html` was added to the generated sitemap.

Not done:

- no fake form submission was sent to avoid generating a test lead email;
- Playwright screenshot QA was not run because this repo does not currently have Playwright installed locally.

## 2026-06-16 — GitHub API visibility surface

User asked whether GitHub is current with local changes and noted that GitHub did not clearly show that Base2026 has a public API.

Actions taken:

- confirmed `origin/main` already contains the live API links, but the README and GitHub Pages copy made the API too easy to miss;
- created a clean worktree from `origin/main` on `codex/base2026-github-api-surface` so generated `web/static/**` and unrelated dirty UI/deploy files are not included;
- promoted the public read-only API/AI access surface near the top of `README.md`;
- expanded `docs/index.html` with API/agent/public dataset quick links.

Not done:

- no deploy, intake, generated release update, or private data movement;
- no commit/push until validation finishes and the final GitHub action is confirmed for this clean branch.

## 2026-06-15 — Current handoff for GSC indexing and Evidence Q&A

User called out context churn: Codex was repeatedly rereading the same long project-memory files after compaction instead of preserving a short active plan.

Actions taken:

- added `docs/project-memory/CURRENT_HANDOFF.md` as the compact resume file for the active GSC/indexing plus Evidence Q&A task;
- updated `NEXT_ACTION.md` to point future resumes at `CURRENT_HANDOFF.md` first;
- added `SEO-01` to `ACTIVE_QUEUE.md` so GSC/indexing and Evidence Q&A work is tracked as a real workstream;
- added durable decisions for compact handoff usage, visible Evidence Q&A before FAQ schema, self-canonical sitemap entries, and strict generated-route 404 behavior;
- preserved the current no-commit/no-deploy constraint.

Verification:

- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/generate-public-pages.py scripts/generate-base2026-sitemap.py scripts/server-patch-nginx-base2026.py` passed;
- `git diff --check -- scripts/generate-public-pages.py scripts/generate-base2026-sitemap.py scripts/server-patch-nginx-base2026.py web/static/styles.css` passed;
- local generated output under `output/tmp-evidence-qa-test` contains source/topic Evidence Q&A sections and no `FAQPage` schema;
- `python3 scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py` passed with forbidden 0, needs_review 0, secret_findings 0.

Not done:

- no commit;
- no deploy;
- no GSC indexing request submitted in this pass.

## 2026-06-15 — Evidence Q&A deploy closed, command-center plan corrected

User asked to stop looping over the same memory reads and keep a real working plan.

Actions taken:

- updated `CURRENT_HANDOFF.md`, `LAUNCH_COMMAND_CENTER.md`, `NEXT_ACTION.md`, and `DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md` so they reflect the live `base2026-gsc-evidence-qa-20260615` release instead of the older no-deploy state;
- marked Evidence Q&A, package QA, deploy, live smoke, strict generated-route behavior, search smoke, gzip/cache check, and mobile visual QA as closed in the command center;
- set the next active row to `GSC-01`;
- kept GitHub/open-source cleanup blocked on closing the stale Dependabot/GitHub Actions PR and replaying work onto a fresh branch from `origin/main`.

Verification:

- release package QA had passed for 1219 source detail pages, 995 topic pages, 995 compare pages, 4 sitemap chunks, 1308 sitemap URLs, self-canonical/indexability checks, and no FAQPage schema;
- live smoke had passed for representative source/topic/noindex pages, missing generated entity routes returned 404, `/knowledge-search/multi-search` returned hits, static CSS served gzip/immutable cache headers, and mobile visual QA passed with 44 checks / 0 failures.

Next:

- inspect Google Search Console and request indexing only for clean self-canonical evidence pages if GSC reports no page-level errors.

## 2026-06-15 — Anti-loop command center plan updated after GSC/GitHub checks

User called out that repeated rereads were wasting context after compaction.

Actions taken:

- kept `CURRENT_HANDOFF.md` and `LAUNCH_COMMAND_CENTER.md` as the active two-file plan;
- updated the command center with GSC Page indexing counts, sitemap refresh success, safe indexing candidates, and the macOS UI-automation blocker for individual URL Inspection requests;
- recorded that stale GitHub PR #1 was closed, open PRs are now 0, and the stale local branch upstream was unset;
- changed the next action from broad rediscovery to two bounded rows: finish clean GSC URL submission, then verify the remote is Actions-free and use a fresh `origin/main` worktree for GitHub cleanup.

Verification:

- no code or generated output was changed in this planning pass;
- tracked memory docs now point future resumes at the compact handoff and command center instead of the full project-memory bundle.

## 2026-06-15 — GitHub publication cleanup merged and Project/Page verified

User pushed to stop looping and finish the GitHub side of the launch task.

Actions taken:

- used a fresh worktree from `origin/main`: `/Users/alexyarosh/Projects/base2026-migration/DW/base2026-github-cleanup-20260615`;
- patched only `README.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/source_correction.yml`, and `scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py`;
- removed README guidance that used `--auto-promote-insights` for public export;
- replaced old IP-based GitHub issue-template links with canonical `https://aggressorbulkit.online/...` URLs;
- tightened the publication-boundary audit so `.github/workflows/`, `.github/dependabot.yml`, `.github/dependabot.yaml`, and `tests/fixtures/public-export-auto-promote/` are not public-safe candidates;
- committed `0918c921d Tighten GitHub publication boundary`, pushed `codex/base2026-github-open-source-cleanup`, opened PR #4, marked it ready, merged it into `main`, and deleted the remote branch;
- verified GitHub Pages is built from `main` `/docs` at `https://offflinerpsy.github.io/base2026/`;
- created public GitHub Project #3 `Base2026 Launch / Open Source`, linked it to `offflinerpsy/base2026`, and added launch items for GitHub publication, Pages, GSC, and final launch audit.

Verification:

- `git diff --check` passed for the four patched files before commit;
- `python3 scripts/validate-github-metadata.py` passed;
- `python3 scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py --json` passed;
- `pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./scripts/preflight-github-launch.ps1 -SkipExportPolicy -SkipLiveCheck` passed before and after merge;
- `gh pr view 4` shows state `MERGED`, merge commit `33745568c2c325887a695c161d69015d566b718f`;
- `gh pr list --state open` returns no open PRs;
- `gh api repos/offflinerpsy/base2026/pages` reports status `built`, source `main` `/docs`, public true, HTTPS enforced;
- `curl -I -L https://offflinerpsy.github.io/base2026/` returns HTTP 200.

Not done:

- GSC individual URL Inspection requests remain unsubmitted because safe automation is blocked by macOS UI permissions and Google Indexing API is not valid for ordinary topic/source pages.

## 2026-06-15 — Parallel launch sidecars accepted; final blocker isolated

User asked whether Codex was looping and requested subagent-backed command-center control instead of repeated rediscovery.

Actions taken:

- spawned and accepted three bounded sidecars:
  - Nash for GSC/indexing evidence;
  - Maxwell for live launch smoke;
  - Kierkegaard for GitHub/open-source hygiene;
- updated `LAUNCH_COMMAND_CENTER.md`, `CURRENT_HANDOFF.md`, and `NEXT_ACTION.md` so future resumes do not restart discovery;
- corrected `NEXT_ACTION.md` so `base2026-controller.py status` no longer reports the old `base2026-clean-replay-pipeline-ay81-20260613` checkpoint as the active next action;
- kept generated `web/static/**` out of context reads and treated it as generated output.

Verification:

- `base2026-controller.py status` now reports the active GSC individual clean-URL submission blocker;
- GSC sidecar confirmed sitemap refresh and `/pricing/` indexing request are proven, while individual Base2026 URL Inspection requests remain UI/manual-blocked;
- live smoke sidecar confirmed robots, 4 sitemap chunks with 1308 URLs, sample source/topic/API pages, visible Q&A, search proxy hits, GitHub Pages HTTP 200, and public GitHub Project HTTP 200;
- GitHub hygiene sidecar confirmed open PRs 0, `origin/main` at `33745568c`, source workflows/dependabot absent, Pages built from `main` `/docs`, metadata/preflight/publication-boundary checks passed, and no forbidden dirty-path matches.

Current blocker:

- `GSC-01` individual clean-URL submission cannot be honestly marked complete until URLs are submitted manually in logged-in GSC or macOS UI automation/screen permissions allow browser automation.

## 2026-06-15 — GSC browser automation blocker verified, loop stopped

User challenged the repeated GSC/indexing loop and asked why Codex was going in circles.

Actions taken:

- resumed from `CURRENT_HANDOFF.md` and `LAUNCH_COMMAND_CENTER.md` only, instead of rereading the full project memory;
- verified the active Chrome tab was still on an invalid raw GSC URL Inspection route returning Google 404;
- restored the Chrome tab to the GSC Page indexing URL for `sc-domain:aggressorbulkit.online`;
- tested macOS UI scripting and confirmed `System Events` is blocked with `Access for assistive devices is disabled. (-1719)`;
- updated `LAUNCH_COMMAND_CENTER.md`, `CURRENT_HANDOFF.md`, and `NEXT_ACTION.md` with the exact blocker so future resumes do not retry the same invalid paths.

Verification:

- `git diff --check -- docs/project-memory/CURRENT_HANDOFF.md docs/project-memory/LAUNCH_COMMAND_CENTER.md docs/project-memory/NEXT_ACTION.md` passed.

Current blocker:

- Individual GSC URL Inspection requests still require either manual logged-in GSC submission or macOS Accessibility/UI automation permission. Direct raw inspect links are proven invalid; Chrome JavaScript execution and `System Events` UI automation are currently denied.

## 2026-06-16 — Base2026 API navigation made global

User noticed that the public API link appeared in the Base2026 header only on methodology/info pages, not globally.

Actions taken:

- confirmed this was not intentional; it was a template/source mismatch;
- added API navigation to `scripts/generate-public-pages.py`, `scripts/generate-info-pages.py`, `web/static/index.html`, and the actual release-root source `web/static/meili.html`;
- fixed `scripts/package-public-hotfix-from-export.ps1` so hotfix packages include `api.html` and the deploy-required metadata/readability files;
- rebuilt and deployed `base2026-api-nav-footer-r3-20260616` as a data-preserving hotfix with `-SkipReindex`.

Verification:

- local release package contains `api.html`, `llms.txt`, `data-dictionary.json`, `api-index.json`, manifest, topic signal briefs, analytics JSON, generated topics/compare indexes, and the API nav/footer links;
- publication-boundary audit passed with `forbidden=0`, `secret_findings=0`;
- public export policy and GitHub metadata validation passed;
- VPS deploy passed with nginx config test successful and `current` symlink pointing to `base2026-api-nav-footer-r3-20260616`;
- live smoke returned 200 and confirmed API nav/footer presence on `/knowledge/`, `/knowledge/api.html`, a source page, a topic page, `/knowledge/creators/`, and `/knowledge/methodology.html`.

## 2026-06-16 — Search-result creator and TikTok links fixed

User reported that in `/knowledge/` search results clicking the creator nickname did not open the creator page, and the TikTok icon was not clickable.

Actions taken:

- changed `web/static/meili.js` result-card creator handles from intercepted workspace-route links to generated creator profile links;
- changed TikTok result badges to render as outbound anchors to the original TikTok source URL when available;
- added hover/focus styling for linked platform badges in `web/static/styles.css`;
- packaged and deployed `base2026-result-links-r1-20260616` as a data-preserving hotfix with `-SkipReindex`.

Verification:

- `node --check web/static/meili.js` passed;
- `git diff --check -- web/static/meili.js web/static/styles.css` passed;
- `python3 scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py` passed with `forbidden=0`, `needs_review=0`, and `secret_findings=0`;
- `python3 scripts/validate-github-metadata.py` passed;
- `python3 scripts/check-public-export-policy.py output/releases/base2026-result-links-r1-20260616/public-data/tiktok` passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`, `source_records=1219`, and `passages=1715`;
- VPS deploy passed with nginx config test successful and `current` symlink pointing to `base2026-result-links-r1-20260616`;
- live smoke confirmed `/knowledge/` loads the new JS/CSS asset version;
- live Playwright interaction QA confirmed the first search-result creator click navigates to `/knowledge/creators/joshuamaraney.html`, and the TikTok badge is an anchor with a `tiktok.com` href.

## 2026-06-16 — Base2026 favicon aligned with main site avatar

User asked to give Base2026 the same face/avatar favicon used by the main WordPress site.

Actions taken:

- copied the existing WordPress avatar favicon assets into Base2026 static assets:
  - `web/static/assets/alex-yarosh-favicon-32.png`
  - `web/static/assets/alex-yarosh-apple-touch.png`
  - `web/static/assets/alex-yarosh-avatar.png`
- added favicon/touch-icon links to `scripts/generate-public-pages.py` and `scripts/generate-info-pages.py` so generated source/topic/creator/compare/info pages keep the favicon after rebuilds;
- added the same links to `web/static/meili.html` and `web/static/index.html` for the search root;
- packaged and deployed `base2026-favicon-avatar-r1-20260616` as a data-preserving hotfix with `-SkipReindex`.

Verification:

- Python generator syntax checks passed;
- `git diff --check` passed for touched favicon/code files;
- publication-boundary audit passed with `forbidden=0`, `needs_review=0`, and `secret_findings=0`;
- GitHub metadata validation passed;
- public export policy passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`, `source_records=1219`, and `passages=1715`;
- release package contains favicon/touch-icon links in `/knowledge/`, info pages, and generated source pages;
- live smoke confirmed `/knowledge/`, `/knowledge/methodology.html`, and a generated source page include the favicon links, and the favicon, touch icon, and avatar PNG assets return 200 as `image/png`.

- live smoke confirmed the social block, X href, disabled TikTok marker, and WordPress `style.css?ver=1.5.44` on the homepage/about page plus the social block on `/knowledge/` and a generated source page.

## 2026-06-16 — Footer social icons normalized and GitHub added

User asked to remove the large footer social chips, keep only aligned social logos, and add GitHub beside X and TikTok.

Actions taken:

- converted the WordPress footer `Socials` block from chip buttons to an icon-only row;
- converted the Base2026 shared footer `Socials` block from chip buttons to the same icon-only row;

## 2026-06-16 — Footer social icons refined to pure logo row

User asked to remove the remaining large social-button feel and keep only equally sized X, TikTok, and GitHub logos in the `Socials` row.

Actions taken:

- tightened `.ay-social-link` in Base2026 and the WordPress child theme to transparent 22x22 icon slots with 20x20 SVG marks, no pill background, no border, and no radius;
- kept X as a working link to `https://x.com/AleksejAros`;

## 2026-06-16 — Darren Shaw intake, latest-card readiness, and avatar fix

User asked to run the current TikTok/source pipeline, use GPT/Codex quality review instead of local LLMs for public card text, keep roadmap/status memory aligned, deploy after checks, and then fix the new creator hero/avatar because it did not match TikTok.

Actions taken:

- polished the current missing transcript text layer locally and rebuilt the KB SQLite database;
- exported the public TikTok dataset with 5 creators, 1,388 source records, and 1,906 public passages;
- created 9 exact-evidence GPT/Codex-reviewed public insight cards for latest source-only records that would otherwise block newest-source readiness;
- evidence-verified, imported, reviewed, promoted, rebuilt, and exported the cards through the existing review/promotion scripts;
- packaged and deployed `base2026-darrenshawseo-intake-ay90-20260616`;
- found the public TikTok profile avatar for `@darrenshawseo`, downloaded it as `web/static/assets/creators/darrenshawseo.jpeg`, and added stable aliases in `config/creator-profiles.json`;
- repackaged and deployed `base2026-darrenshawseo-intake-ay90-r2-20260616`;
- reindexed Meilisearch with 1,906 public documents.

Verification:

- `python3 scripts/kb-audit.py` passed after rebuild;
- `python3 scripts/base2026-evidence-verify.py` passed for 9 candidates with exact evidence matches;
- `python3 scripts/base2026-review-insight-candidates.py` returned 9 promotion candidates with no warnings/failures;
- `python3 scripts/check-public-export-policy.py` passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`, `source_records=1388`, `passages=1906`, `insight_cards=1623`, and `public_insight_cards=1052`;
- `python3 scripts/validate-public-release-contract.py` passed with 0 violations;
- `python3 scripts/check-public-content-readiness.py --latest 10 --fail` passed with 0 blocked newest source-only records;
- `python3 scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py` passed with `forbidden=0`, `needs_review=0`, and `secret_findings=0`;
- `python3 scripts/validate-github-metadata.py` passed;
- nginx deploy and Meilisearch reindex passed, with deploy task `335`;
- live smoke confirmed `/knowledge/`, the Darren creator/source pages, `/knowledge/api.html`, `/knowledge/sitemap.xml`, the real Darren avatar image asset, and no `Source record unavailable` state;
- live mobile Playwright QA confirmed the real `details > summary` hamburger menu opens, Base2026 subnav is visible, API/Search links are visible, horizontal overflow is 0, and browser console errors are 0.

Follow-up consistency check:

- synced canonical `public-data/tiktok` from the Darren export after noticing `base2026-controller.py status` still saw stale 4-creator local data;
- regenerated public topic signal briefs and analytics artifacts from the updated canonical export;
- confirmed `base2026-controller.py status` now reports `base2026-darrenshawseo-intake-ay90-r2-20260616`, 5 creators, 1,388 source records, 1,906 passages, 1,623 insight cards, and 1,052 public insight cards;
- reran canonical export policy, release contract, newest-source readiness, publication-boundary audit, GitHub metadata validation, `git diff --check`, and live smoke after the sync.

## 2026-06-16 — Local source-evidence disclosure cleanup

User asked whether `Show source evidence` was displaying correctly because it felt wrong.

Finding:

- the concern was valid: many generated source pages showed clipped evidence snippets starting mid-word or mid-sentence inside the Source Intelligence disclosure;
- examples included fragments like `or demographic...`, `ot sure...`, `ure...`, `rand...`, `ur phone...`, and `sionally...`;
- those snippets were usually already contained in the visible `Source Text`, so exposing them separately was redundant and looked broken.

Actions taken locally:

- updated `scripts/generate-public-pages.py` so source insight evidence disclosures treat fragmentary evidence already present in `Source Text` as duplicate evidence;
- regenerated `web/static` from `public-data/tiktok`;
- confirmed the bad sample pages now show `Evidence is in Source Text` instead of opening clipped fragments.

Verification:

- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/generate-public-pages.py` passed;
- `python3 scripts/generate-public-pages.py --data public-data/tiktok --out web/static` generated 1,388 source pages;
- local scan found 1 remaining readable standalone `Show source evidence` disclosure, 658 `Evidence is in Source Text` disclosures, and 0 remaining disclosure bodies starting with a lowercase/mid-word fragment;
- `git diff --check`, public export policy, and GitHub metadata validation passed;
- Playwright snapshot against local `web/static` confirmed a previously broken source page now renders the insight card with `Evidence is in Source Text`.

Deployment status: not deployed yet. Package/deploy as a data-preserving UI hotfix only after a separate live-deploy instruction.

## 2026-06-16 — Source-evidence disclosure cleanup deployed

User confirmed the source-evidence disclosure cleanup should be deployed after noticing the local fix had not reached live.

Actions taken:

- corrected `scripts/generate-public-pages.py` so duplicate-only insight evidence does not render a placeholder disclosure;
- corrected `web/static/meili.js` so runtime source workspace uses the same fragment/duplicate evidence rule as generated source pages;
- regenerated `web/static`;
- removed temporary `.playwright-cli` browser snapshots before publication-boundary validation;
- packaged and deployed `base2026-source-evidence-disclosure-r2-20260616` as a data-preserving hotfix with `-SkipReindex`.

Verification:

- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/generate-public-pages.py` passed;
- `python3 scripts/generate-public-pages.py --data public-data/tiktok --out web/static` generated 1,388 source pages;
- local scan confirmed `Evidence is in Source Text` and `Evidence is already included in the Source Text above.` are absent from generated source pages and runtime JS;
- `git diff --check`, public export policy, GitHub metadata validation, and publication-boundary audit passed;
- package gates passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`, `source_records=1388`, `passages=1906`, `insight_cards=1623`, and `public_insight_cards=1052`;
- nginx deploy succeeded and `/var/www/base2026-knowledge/current` now points to `base2026-source-evidence-disclosure-r2-20260616`;
- live HTTP smoke confirmed the release marker and no old evidence placeholder strings on `/knowledge/`, the reported Darren Shaw runtime URL, the matching static source page, and live `meili.js`;
- live Playwright DOM checks confirmed the reported Darren Shaw runtime URL and static source page contain `Source Text` and `Source Intelligence`, do not show `Source record unavailable`, and no longer contain the old evidence placeholder strings.

Meilisearch reindex was intentionally skipped because public data and index fields did not change.

## 2026-06-17 — Source Intelligence missing-block investigation

User asked to investigate missing `Source Intelligence` blocks on two live source-detail/search URLs:

- `tiktok-video-7621472877765823766`;
- `tiktok-video-7631848100860103958`.

Finding:

- both sources are public `@webhivedigital` source records with reviewed public source text;
- both have insight-card rows in the public export, but all six linked rows are `public=false`, `review_status=pending`, and `public_policy=needs_review`;
- `@webhivedigital` is not globally broken: the public export currently has 259 `@webhivedigital` insight rows, including 113 public cards;
- the two reported sources are therefore a source-specific reviewed-card gap, not a creator-wide data failure;
- there was also a product-level rendering gap: source detail hid the entire `Source Intelligence` section when a source had no reviewed/public cards, leaving no honest empty state.

Actions taken locally:

- updated `web/static/meili.js` so runtime source detail always renders `Source Intelligence`; reviewed/public cards render as before, while no-card sources show an empty state instead of disappearing;
- updated `scripts/generate-public-pages.py` so generated source pages use the same Source Intelligence empty-state contract;
- updated `scripts/mobile-visual-qa.mjs` with two regression routes:
  - `base-source-intelligence-reviewed` expects a selected source with reviewed public cards to render Source Intelligence cards;
  - `base-source-intelligence-empty` expects a selected no-reviewed-card source to render the empty state.

Verification:

- `node --check web/static/meili.js` passed;
- `node --check scripts/mobile-visual-qa.mjs` passed;
- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/generate-public-pages.py` passed;
- temporary static generation to `/tmp/base2026-source-intel-test` generated 1,388 source pages, 1,001 topic pages, 1,001 compare pages, and 5 creator pages;
- generated checks confirmed both reported source pages contain `Source Intelligence` plus the empty state, while `tiktok-video-7651937569034341640` still renders a real insight card;
- live Playwright confirmed the current live reported URLs have `Source Text` but no `Source Intelligence` before deploy;
- live Playwright confirmed the reviewed-card route has Source Intelligence cards after async card load;
- intercepted-live Playwright using local `meili.js` plus live JSONL confirmed the no-card source renders the empty state and the reviewed-card source still renders one card;
- public export policy, latest-source content-readiness, `git diff --check`, and publication-boundary audit passed.

Deployment status: not deployed. Do not promote the six pending cards or invent public insight content; use `scripts/base2026-review-insight-candidates.py` and `scripts/base2026-promote-insight-candidates.py` only through the normal evidence-gated review path if content promotion is requested.

## 2026-06-17 — Source-detail readability/layout hotfix deployed

User reported that `/knowledge/index.html?source=tiktok-video-7651937569034341640` still rendered source text as one unreadable wall of text and that source-detail share/meta controls were visually scattered.

Actions taken:

- fixed `web/static/meili.js` readable text handling so runtime source detail preserves existing paragraph breaks, splits normal sentence text, and chunks poorly punctuated ASR/TikTok text into readable paragraphs;
- added the same readable text contract to `scripts/generate-public-pages.py` so generated source pages and runtime source detail do not diverge;
- suppressed duplicated source-title/summary lead copy when it repeats the visible source text;
- compacted the source-detail toolbar so author identity, share icons, and meta chips sit in a more coherent top block;
- added share/copy/print controls beside `Source Intelligence`;
- regenerated public pages and info pages;
- packaged and deployed `base2026-source-detail-readability-ay36-20260617` as a data-preserving UI hotfix with `-SkipReindex`.

Verification:

- `node --check web/static/meili.js` passed;
- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/generate-public-pages.py scripts/generate-info-pages.py` passed;
- `python3 scripts/generate-public-pages.py --data public-data/tiktok --out web/static` generated 1,388 source pages, 1,001 topic pages, 1,001 compare pages, and 5 creator pages;
- `python3 scripts/generate-info-pages.py --out web/static` generated 9 info pages;
- local Playwright desktop/mobile checks on the reported source URL passed with readable source paragraphs, no duplicate lead, 4 header share actions, 4 Source Intelligence share actions, no horizontal overflow, and no `Source record unavailable`;
- `git diff --check`, publication-boundary audit, and public export policy passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- package gates passed for 1,388 source records, 1,906 passages, 1,623 insight cards, 1,052 public insight cards, 1,516 topics, 1,001 public topics, and 5 creators;
- nginx deploy succeeded and `/var/www/base2026-knowledge/current` now points to `base2026-source-detail-readability-ay36-20260617`;
- live HTTP smoke confirmed `/knowledge/` serves `styles.css` and `meili.js` with release cache-bust `base2026-source-detail-readability-ay36-20260617`;
- live Playwright desktop/mobile checks confirmed the reported source detail has 6 readable source paragraphs, no duplicate lead, 4 header share actions, 4 Source Intelligence share actions, no horizontal overflow, no visible cookie banner, and no unavailable source state.

Meilisearch reindex was intentionally skipped because public data and index fields did not change.
## 2026-06-17 — Ahrefs Site Audit export and backlog creation

User asked to open Ahrefs Site Audit export for `https://app.ahrefs.com/site-audit/9961307/export`, download the full report, break it into parts, and turn all issues into a task plan for later review/code-audit work.

Actions:

- opened the Ahrefs Bulk Export page in the logged-in Chrome session;
- confirmed the project page loaded as `Bulk export - Aggressorbulkit`;
- found the bulk ZIP button disabled and exported the enabled CSV sections individually;
- copied 19 CSV exports into ignored local storage at `output/ahrefs/site-audit-9961307-20260617/raw/`;
- parsed the CSV exports into local analysis files under `output/ahrefs/site-audit-9961307-20260617/analysis/`;
- captured the high-level Ahrefs Issues screen counts;
- created tracked backlog docs:
  - `docs/project-memory/AHREFS_SITE_AUDIT_BACKLOG_2026_06_17.md`;
  - `docs/project-memory/AHREFS_SITE_AUDIT_TASKS_2026_06_17.csv`;
- added `.seo-cache/` to `.gitignore` and wrote local reusable SEO cache summaries there.

Findings:

- P0 work is broken URL and redirect cleanup: analytics root-relative Base2026 links, `/author/` 404 links, and 5,765 links to redirecting `/contact/`.
- P1 work is crawl architecture and metadata contract: orphan source pages, query-state duplicate paths, OG/Twitter tags, schema validation, and sitemap canonical hygiene.
- P2/P3 work is title/meta tuning, noindex link policy, crawl-budget retest, image/CSS optimization, and IndexNow/GSC only after the structural fixes are live.

No site fixes, deploy, commit, push, or intake automation were performed in this pass.

## 2026-06-17 — AHREFS-P1-06 social metadata local review

User approved continuing with the next recommended SEO step: evidence-led indexation and shared social metadata, without committing or deploying first.

Actions:

- confirmed current project contract from `AGENTS.md` and project memory;
- used local SEO/programmatic/content/AI SEO skills and repo files as source of truth;
- added shared OG/X metadata helpers to `scripts/generate-public-pages.py` and `scripts/generate-info-pages.py`;
- added complete OG/X metadata to `web/static/index.html` and `web/static/meili.html`;
- regenerated `web/static` public pages and info pages locally;
- regenerated `web/static/sitemap.xml` from indexable self-canonical pages;
- marked `AHREFS-P1-06` as `local-reviewed` in `docs/project-memory/AHREFS_SITE_AUDIT_TASKS_2026_06_17.csv`;
- documented the local-reviewed status in `docs/project-memory/AHREFS_SITE_AUDIT_BACKLOG_2026_06_17.md` and `docs/project-memory/NEXT_ACTION.md`.

Verification:

- Python compile passed for `scripts/generate-public-pages.py`, `scripts/generate-info-pages.py`, and `scripts/generate-base2026-sitemap.py`;
- temporary public/info generation passed;
- representative real `web/static` page checks passed for source, topic, compare, creator, analytics, roadmap, API, and search entrypoints;
- full local indexable HTML social metadata scan passed for 1,483 indexable pages; 1,929 noindex pages were skipped;
- sitemap generation produced 1,482 URLs;
- public export policy passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- publication-boundary audit passed with `forbidden=0`, `needs_review=0`, and `secret_findings=0`;
- GitHub metadata validation and targeted `git diff --check` passed.

No deploy, commit, push, GSC submission, IndexNow submission, or TikTok intake was performed.

## 2026-06-18 — GitHub source-tree cleanup and API documentation pass

User asked to proceed with the recommended GitHub/publication cleanup so Base2026 is clean, credible, and ready for startup submissions.

Actions:

- updated `README.md` to the current live release `base2026-social-metadata-h1-ay39-20260618` and current public export counts;
- fixed `scripts/generate-info-pages.py` inline Markdown rendering so code spans are protected before emphasis conversion;
- regenerated public info pages so `/knowledge/api.html` renders file names such as `topic_signal_briefs.jsonl` correctly;
- expanded `web/static/api-index.json` with public entry points and route templates in addition to static public data endpoints;
- added API/AI access as a GitHub feature-request area;
- updated `.gitignore`, `docs/GIT_PUBLICATION_AUDIT.md`, and `docs/project-memory/PUBLICATION_BOUNDARY.md` so generated source/topic/compare/creator pages, generated sitemap files, and generated analytics JSON/JSONL are release artifacts rather than GitHub source;
- removed generated public pages and generated sitemap/analytics artifacts from the Git index with `git rm --cached` while leaving the files on disk for local generation, QA, packaging, and deploy;
- tightened `scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py` so generated `web/static` artifacts are blocked if added/modified, while staged index-cleanup deletions are allowed.

Verification:

- Python compile passed for publication audit, public page/info/sitemap generators, export policy, and GitHub metadata scripts;
- Node syntax passed for `scripts/mobile-visual-qa.mjs` and `web/static/meili.js`;
- `git diff --check` passed;
- publication-boundary audit passed with `forbidden=0`, `needs_review=0`, and `secret_findings=0`;
- public export policy passed with `include_full_transcripts=false`, 1,388 source records, 1,906 passages, and 1,052 public insight cards;
- GitHub metadata validation passed;
- API-index JSON validation passed;
- GitHub preflight passed with live/export checks skipped to avoid side effects.

No deploy, reindex, GSC submission, IndexNow submission, or TikTok intake was performed in this GitHub-only cleanup pass.

## 2026-06-18 — Canonical TikTok release gate and ay40 data deploy

User asked to stop improvising the pipeline and make Base2026 releases run like a clock, using prior mistakes as durable engineering constraints.

Actions:

- added `scripts/base2026-release-gate.ps1` as the canonical TikTok/data release command center;
- added safe `-Help` behavior to `scripts/hermes-tiktok-refresh.ps1` so help cannot accidentally run inventory/intake work;
- documented repeated pipeline mistakes and fixed rules in `docs/project-memory/PIPELINE_ERROR_LEDGER.md`;
- updated `HERMES_RUNBOOK.md` and `DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md` to route data-changing releases through the release gate;
- ran the 2026-06-18 TikTok batch `hermes-polish-20260618-034106` through the polish gate and `AfterPolish`;
- fixed the newest-source readiness blocker for `@webhivedigital` / `tiktok-video-7652365345709231382` by adding one exact-evidence reviewed public insight for `WordPress SEO / plugin capabilities`;
- packaged and deployed `base2026-tiktok-refresh-ay40-20260618`;
- reindexed Meilisearch with 1,911 public passages.

Verification:

- current live export: 1,392 source records, 1,911 passages, 1,624 insight cards, 1,053 public insight cards, 1,516 topics, 1,001 public topics, 5 creators;
- `include_full_transcripts=false`;
- live fresh source page returns 200;
- Meilisearch smoke query finds the fresh `@webhivedigital` source;
- live SEO crawl gate passed 500 crawled pages with 0 P0 bad links and 0 crawled error pages;
- full mobile visual QA passed on rerun with 78 checks and 0 failures after one transient connection reset on the first run.

No commit or push was performed.

## 2026-06-18 — Free social intake recommendations Phase 1/2

User asked to read `docs/research/FREE_SOCIAL_VIDEO_INTAKE_RECOMMENDATIONS_2026_06_18.md` and implement Phase 1 and Phase 2 only.

Actions:

- hardened `scripts/base2026-worker.py doctor` so required tools, optional adapters, and intake capabilities are reported explicitly;
- added `scripts/social-discover.py` as a platform-neutral private discovery adapter;
- kept TikTok discovery `yt-dlp --flat-playlist` first and `gallery-dl` fallback-only;
- made Instagram discovery report `missing_adapter_gallery_dl` instead of pretending to work when optional adapters are absent;
- documented optional `gallery-dl`, `instaloader`, and `whisper.cpp` install/capability behavior in local worker and Hermes runbooks;
- updated command-center memory so Phase 1/2 is a real pipeline step, not chat memory.

Verification:

- Python compile passed for `scripts/base2026-worker.py`, `scripts/social-discover.py`, and `scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py`;
- `.venv/bin/python scripts/base2026-worker.py doctor` passed and reported TikTok primary discovery available, TikTok fallback disabled without `gallery-dl`, Instagram disabled without `gallery-dl`/`instaloader`, ASR primary available, and optional CPU ASR disabled without `whisper.cpp`;
- TikTok discovery smoke over the 5 current creators wrote 15 private source rows to `.planning/social-discovered.jsonl` using `tiktok_yt_dlp_flat_playlist`;
- Instagram capability smoke wrote one private failure row with `missing_adapter_gallery_dl`;
- `.planning/` outputs are ignored by Git;
- `12_knowledge-base/sources/tiktok/videos.csv` hash stayed `2c79f3841c925f4f2c9b4a510160bcd3e403f355724547acd8ad8161c902beab`.

No deploy, reindex, public export, intake import, commit, push, GSC submission, or `public-data/tiktok` modification was performed.

## 2026-06-18 — Social discovery Phase 3 bridge into private TikTok queue

User asked to stop pausing at phase boundaries and make the new-creator/social intake pipeline usable instead of theoretical.

Actions:

- added `scripts/import-social-discovery-to-tiktok-csv.py` as the dry-run-first bridge from `.planning/social-discovered.jsonl` into private local `12_knowledge-base/sources/tiktok/videos.csv`;
- kept the bridge TikTok-only, skipped discovery failures and non-TikTok rows, deduped by `video_id`, and preserved current `queued` / `out_of_scope_old` status semantics;
- made the bridge fill only missing safe metadata on existing rows;
- made every `--apply` create an ignored backup under `.planning/backups/`;
- added the importer to the publication-boundary allowlist and documented the bridge in the local worker spec, Hermes runbook, launch command center, error ledger, data sources, decisions, handoff, and next action.

Verification:

- Python compile passed for `scripts/import-social-discovery-to-tiktok-csv.py`, `scripts/social-discover.py`, `scripts/base2026-worker.py`, and `scripts/audit-publication-boundary.py`;
- dry-run over `.planning/social-discovered.jsonl` found 15 TikTok candidates, 14 existing rows, and 1 new recent queued row;
- apply created `.planning/backups/videos-before-social-import-20260618-081415.csv`, added `tiktok-video-7652732487843581206`, and filled safe missing metadata on 14 existing rows;
- post-apply dry-run was idempotent with 15 duplicate existing rows, 0 added rows, and 0 updated rows;
- found and fixed a runner bug where `hermes-tiktok-refresh.ps1 -CheckOnly` still ran the mutating inventory stage before checking the flag;
- verified the fixed `-CheckOnly -PlaylistEnd 3` preserved the exact `videos.csv` hash before/after while reporting one additional unapplied candidate;
- intentionally applied that additional `@darrenshawseo` candidate through the bridge, with a second ignored backup;
- private CSV now has 3348 rows: 1392 transcribed, 1937 out-of-scope-old, 16 needs-source-review, and 3 queued.

No public export, deploy, reindex, commit, push, GSC submission, or generated public data modification was performed.

## 2026-06-18 — Pipeline 3-source ay41 deploy

User pushed to stop pausing at phase boundaries and prove the pipeline can actually move new sources to live content.

Actions:

- created polished transcript files and QA JSON for the 3 queued social-bridge sources in `hermes-polish-20260618-social-bridge`;
- ran the current-batch transcript polish gate and fixed QA note wording/word-count metadata until it passed cleanly;
- ran `pwsh ./scripts/hermes-tiktok-refresh.ps1 -AfterPolish -BatchSet hermes-polish-20260618-social-bridge`;
- let newest-source readiness block the fresh `@build_in_public` source because it had public text but no public topic/insight layer;
- added one strict exact-evidence reviewed public insight for `tiktok-video-7652732487843581206` under `Search Console / high-intent queries`;
- reran `AfterPolish`, packaged with `scripts/base2026-release-gate.ps1 -PackageOnly`, then deployed with `scripts/base2026-release-gate.ps1 -Deploy`;
- updated project memory so the next run sees ay41 live and queue closed.

Result:

- live release: `base2026-pipeline-3sources-ay41-20260618`;
- public export: 1395 source records, 1915 passages, 1625 insight cards, 1054 public insight cards, 1517 topics, 1002 public topics, 5 creators;
- Meilisearch: 1915 public passages, task `343`;
- live QA: SEO crawl gate 500 pages with 0 P0 bad links and 0 crawled error pages; mobile visual QA 78 checks / 0 failures.

No commit or push was performed.

## 2026-06-18 — ay41 source-of-truth/controller fix

After deploy, controller status still read the stale ay39 release from `PROJECT_STATE.md`. Codex updated `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md`, `ACTIVE_QUEUE.md`, and `LAUNCH_COMMAND_CENTER.md` to point at `base2026-pipeline-3sources-ay41-20260618`, made `scripts/base2026-daily-digest.py` understand the current `Next safe action` heading, and verified `base2026-controller.py status` reports ay41 with `deployment_blocked=false`. Final public/private gates passed after the memory update.

## 2026-06-18 — AI Recommends Solutions ay42 creator pass

User provided five new TikTok creators: `@heytonyagency`, `@iamdandavies`, `@harrysandersseo`, `@ray_fu`, and `@gobigsystems`, and asked to process/deploy through the pipeline instead of stopping at planning.

Actions:

- added the five creator feeds to ignored local intake config;
- ran private social discovery into `.planning/`: 200 source records across 10 configured creators, 0 failures;
- ran importer dry-run/apply into private local `videos.csv`: 100 new candidate rows added, safe missing metadata updated, ignored backup created;
- ran Hermes refresh as `hermes-polish-20260618-ai-recommends`: 100 selected captions, 77 transcribed/polished, 23 `needs_asr`, 0 failed;
- ran GPT polish/QA: 30 passed, 47 `needs_review`, 0 failed;
- gated the 47 QA-needs-review rows as `needs_source_review` instead of publishing uncertain transcript/source text;
- fixed `scripts/hermes-tiktok-refresh.ps1 -AfterPolish` so it skips inventory/caption intake and only rebuilds from reviewed polish outputs;
- added one exact-evidence reviewed public insight for `@iamdandavies` / `tiktok-video-7652708771701067030` under `WordPress static homepage setup`;
- deployed `base2026-ai-recommends-creators-ay42-20260618` through `scripts/base2026-release-gate.ps1`.

Result:

- live release: `base2026-ai-recommends-creators-ay42-20260618`;
- public export: 1425 source records, 1953 passages, 1626 insight cards, 1055 public insight cards, 1518 topics, 1003 public topics, 10 creators;
- Meilisearch: 1953 public passages;
- live QA: SEO crawl gate 500 pages with 0 P0 bad links and 0 crawled error pages; mobile visual QA 78 checks / 0 failures;
- public/private gates passed: publication boundary, export policy, GitHub metadata, public release contract, newest-source readiness.

No commit or push was performed.

## 2026-06-18 — ASR-review polish pass and WordPress about hero hotfix

User asked why the new creator videos were not continuing through review and showed that the `/about/` hero was still visually oversized.

Actions:

- created `hermes-polish-20260618-asr-review` batches 001-003 for the remaining ASR-review queue;
- ran `scripts/run-hermes-polish-worker.ps1` with the GPT-5.5 lane;
- created 21 polished transcript files and 21 QA JSON files under the private TikTok transcript folders;
- kept review-gated rows private instead of forcing them into public export;
- tightened the WordPress `/about/` first hero CSS and deployed theme `style.css` version `1.5.51`.

Verification:

- transcript QA totals: 10 pass, 11 needs_review, 0 failed;
- current private `videos.csv` inventory has 3448 rows, 0 `needs_asr`, and 64 `needs_source_review` after the later source-review recount: 48 local-caption review rows, 14 audio-backed ASR-retry rows, and 2 rows without usable local caption/audio;
- live `/about/` loads `style.css?ver=1.5.51`;
- live Playwright checks at 1440x900, 1280x800, and 390x844 showed no horizontal overflow, the next section visible after the hero, and a compact hero height of 435px at 1280x800.

No Base2026 public export, Base2026 deploy, Meilisearch reindex, commit, or push was performed in this pass.

## 2026-06-19 — Source-review queue hardening

User asked why video review stopped and pushed to keep Hermes/ISR work moving without bloating project memory. Codex added `scripts/tiktok-source-review-queue.py` so private `needs_source_review` rows are listed from actual local evidence availability before any status changes.

Current queue facts from the script:

- total held rows: 61;
- 45 `local_caption_exists` rows require source/QA review before public release;
- 14 `audio_available_retry_asr` rows should go through ASR retry before review;
- 2 `no_local_caption_or_audio` rows stay private until source/audio exists;
- QA status counts: 45 `needs_review`, 16 missing QA JSON.

No public export, deploy, reindex, source status mutation, commit, or push was performed until the new queue tool and docs passed gates.

## 2026-06-19 — ASR retry hardening and ay45 deploy

User asked to continue after the connection dropped and to avoid repeating the same pipeline mistakes. Codex hardened `scripts/tiktok-process-transcripts.ps1` so ASR retries dedupe notes, parse noisy worker JSON, and report `asr_too_little`, `asr_no_usable`, `asr_no_audio`, and `asr_worker_parse_failed`.

Result:

- retried 14 audio-backed source-review rows;
- 1 `@gobigsystems` row produced usable ASR, passed polish QA, and shipped publicly;
- 13 weak/no-speech ASR rows stayed private as `needs_source_review`;
- deployed `base2026-asr-gobig-pipeline-ay45-20260619` through `scripts/base2026-release-gate.ps1 -RunAfterPolish -Deploy`;
- public export is now 1452 source records, 1980 passages, 1629 insight cards, 1058 public insight cards, 1521 topics, 1006 public topics, and 10 creators;
- Meilisearch reindexed 1980 public passages;
- live SEO crawl passed 500 pages with 0 P0 bad links and 0 crawled error pages;
- full mobile visual QA rerun passed 78 checks with 0 failures after one transient Meilisearch fetch reset in the first attempt.

## 2026-06-19 — Local-caption source-review clearance and ay47 deploy

User asked whether the work had looped and whether the plan was still coherent. Codex verified the bounded state, found that ay47 was live on the server while project memory still described ay46, and closed the mismatch instead of rereading the whole project.

Actions:

- reviewed the source-review queue from `scripts/tiktok-source-review-queue.py`;
- mechanically cleaned three local-caption source-review transcripts;
- approved them through private QA manifest and `scripts/tiktok-qa-review-apply.py`;
- added `scripts/tiktok-clear-reviewed-source-rows.py` so explicit QA-pass source-review rows can safely return to `transcribed`;
- deployed `base2026-source-review-local-caption-ay47-20260619` through the canonical release gate.

Verification:

- live symlink points to `base2026-source-review-local-caption-ay47-20260619`;
- public export now has 1,455 source records and 1,986 passages;
- Meilisearch reindexed 1,986 public passages;
- live SEO crawl gate passed with 500 crawled pages, 0 P0 bad links, and 0 crawled error pages;
- mobile visual QA passed 78 checks with 0 failures;
- private source-review queue is now 57 rows: 42 local-caption, 13 audio-backed too-little/no-speech, and 2 no-source rows.

## 2026-06-19 — Local-caption source-review clearance batch 002 and ay48 deploy

User asked whether the work was looping after a long run. Codex resumed from the bounded ay47 state instead of re-reading the full project memory, selected the next three `local_caption_exists` source-review rows, and processed only the evidence that could be mechanically verified from local raw/clean/polished transcript files.

Actions:

- mechanically corrected `LinkSeeker.io`, `FindQuestions.com`, and `9,600` formatting in the private polished transcripts for `7635790305647742216`, `7636073338426641682`, and `7637620554882649362`;
- approved those three rows through a private QA manifest and `scripts/tiktok-qa-review-apply.py`;
- cleared only those explicit QA-pass rows back to `transcribed` with `scripts/tiktok-clear-reviewed-source-rows.py`;
- deployed `base2026-source-review-local-caption-ay48-20260619` through the canonical release gate.

Verification:

## 2026-06-19 — Local-caption source-review clearance batch 003 and ay49 deploy

User asked whether the long run was finished and what remained. Codex resumed from the bounded ay48 state, selected the next three `local_caption_exists` source-review rows, and processed only mechanical caption corrections that could be checked against local raw/clean/polished transcript evidence.

Actions:

- mechanically corrected `Claude Code`/`Claude`, `one-line change`, `AdSense`, `ElevenLabs`, `Pexels`, `TubeBuddy`, `vidIQ`, `Have I Been Pwned`, `Spokeo`, `BeenVerified`, `CCPA opt-out`, `JustDeleteMe.xyz`, and related formatting in the private polished transcripts for `7639236297046969631`, `7639961828809837855`, and `7641436180252216606`;
- approved those three rows through a private QA manifest and `scripts/tiktok-qa-review-apply.py`;
- cleared only those explicit QA-pass rows back to `transcribed` with `scripts/tiktok-clear-reviewed-source-rows.py`;

## 2026-06-19 — Local-caption source-review clearance batch 004 and ay50 deploy

User asked whether the long run was finished and what remained. Codex resumed from the bounded ay49 state, selected the next three `local_caption_exists` source-review rows, and processed only mechanical caption corrections checked against local raw/clean/polished transcript evidence.

Actions:

- mechanically corrected Google I/O/Google Omni/Omni Flash, Claude for Small Business/QuickBooks/PayPal/HubSpot/Canva/Claude Cowork, em dashes/Wispr Flow/GPT, and paragraph breaks in the private polished transcripts for `7642212024415505694`, `7643684092189396255`, and `7644052372095782175`;

## 2026-06-19 — Local-caption source-review clearance batch 005 and ay51 deploy

User asked whether the 10-hour run was finished and what remained. Codex resumed from the bounded ay50 state, selected the next source-review candidates, skipped one unsafe `@ray_fu` local-caption row with unresolved product/model names, and processed only three rows whose mechanical corrections could be checked against local raw/clean/polished transcript evidence.

Actions:

- mechanically corrected source-review rows for `7644940442081021191`, `7645548627682757918`, and `7646211090124115207`;

## 2026-06-19 — Local-caption source-review clearance batch 006 and ay52 deploy

User asked whether the 10-hour run was finished and what remained. Codex resumed from the bounded ay51 state, selected the next local-caption source-review candidates, skipped unsafe/uncertain rows with unresolved entity, product, model, visual, or source dependence, and processed only six rows whose corrections could be checked against local raw/clean/polished transcript evidence.

Actions:

- mechanically corrected private polished transcripts for `7647005483651403039`, `7647365392070921503`, `7647707942870879495`, `7649790012220820754`, `7649798302174547222`, and `7649853023690312982`;

## 2026-06-19 — Source Intelligence/Q&A contract fix and ay54 deploy

User reported that `https://aggressorbulkit.online/knowledge/sources/tiktok-video-7652384458804432136.html` had no Source Intelligence and that "Questions this source answers" repeated the opening source text.

Root cause:

- `scripts/generate-public-pages.py` allowed source-page Q&A to render from `summary_long`, `summary_short`, `sentence_excerpt(public_text, ...)`, and a generic topic fallback when no reviewed public insight existed.

Actions:

- added one strict reviewed public Source Intelligence candidate for `@darrenshawseo` / `tiktok-video-7652384458804432136` under `Local SEO service-area rankings`;
- changed generated source-page Q&A so it renders only from reviewed Source Intelligence cards and never from raw source-text fallbacks;
- rebuilt SQLite, exported public TikTok data, packaged, deployed, and reindexed Meilisearch as `base2026-source-intelligence-contract-ay54-20260619`.

Verification:

- public export now has 1,476 source records, 2,016 passages, 1,631 insight cards, 1,060 public insight cards, 1,522 topics, 1,008 public topics, and 10 creators;
- release gate passed newest-source readiness `--latest 3`, publication boundary, GitHub metadata, public export policy, public release contract, VPS deploy/reindex, live SEO crawl, and mobile visual QA 78/0;
- direct live smoke confirmed the reported source page has Source Intelligence, no empty state, and no old raw-source Q&A fallback.
