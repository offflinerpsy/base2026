# Deployment Runbook

Current public path:

- Root URL: `https://aggressorbulkit.online/`
- Base2026 URL: `https://aggressorbulkit.online/knowledge/`
- WordPress root: `/var/www/alex-yarosh`
- server current symlink: `/var/www/base2026-knowledge/current`
- server releases: `/var/www/base2026-knowledge/releases/`
- latest deployed release: `base2026-source-intelligence-contract-ay54-20260619`
- SSL certificate: Let's Encrypt `aggressorbulkit.online`, domains `aggressorbulkit.online` and `www.aggressorbulkit.online`, auto-renewed by `certbot.timer`

Latest WordPress root visual pass: `alex-yarosh` child theme `style.css?ver=1.5.63`, applied directly on 2026-06-19 for the compact `/about/` founder hero. Cache Enabler generated cache for `aggressorbulkit.online` should be cleared after direct theme updates.

## Domain and SSL

The nginx site `alex-yarosh` serves WordPress at the root and aliases Base2026 under `/knowledge/`.

The `/knowledge/static/` location should be declared before the broader `/knowledge/` alias and should set long-lived immutable cache headers plus gzip for CSS, JS, JSON, and SVG assets. The broader `/knowledge/` location serves HTML and fallback routing.

Canonical domain:

```text
https://aggressorbulkit.online
```

WordPress options must stay aligned:

```bash
cd /var/www/alex-yarosh
wp option get home --allow-root
wp option get siteurl --allow-root
```

Expected value for both:

```text
https://aggressorbulkit.online
```

SSL check:

```bash
certbot certificates
systemctl list-timers | grep certbot
nginx -t
```

## Local package

Current live release: `base2026-source-intelligence-contract-ay54-20260619`.

Latest data/reindex checkpoint: `base2026-source-intelligence-contract-ay54-20260619`.

This checkpoint fixes the source-detail Source Intelligence/Q&A contract and deploys `base2026-source-intelligence-contract-ay54-20260619`. Current live export has 1,476 public source records, 2,016 public passages, 1,631 insight cards, 1,060 public insight cards, 1,522 topics, 1,008 public topics, and 10 creators. Meilisearch was reindexed with 2,016 public passages during ay54 deploy.

The `base2026-api-nav-footer-r3-20260616` deploy changed generated HTML/navigation and the hotfix packaging contract only. It intentionally skipped Meilisearch reindex because public data and index fields did not change. The deploy fixed global `/knowledge/api.html` navigation in the search root, generated pages, mobile Base2026 nav, and footer.

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\package-public-release.ps1 -ReleaseName <release-name>
```

Current public packages use reviewed public source text where policy allows. Public package/deploy scripts must not expose `-IncludeFullTranscripts` as a public shortcut and must not call `--auto-promote-insights`. Raw captions, raw ASR, media, private QA, and unreviewed transcripts stay private. Private/gated review exports should use `scripts/export-public-tiktok.py --out <ignored-private-dir>` directly and must not be deployed as the public `/knowledge/` release.

For explicitly approved data-preserving hotfixes where the current ignored `public-data/tiktok` membership/counts must be preserved while static UI/page rendering is repaired, use:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\package-public-hotfix-from-export.ps1 -ReleaseName <release-name> -MeiliUrl /knowledge-search
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\deploy-public-vps.ps1 -ReleaseName <release-name> -SkipPackage -SkipReindex
```

This hotfix path copies the existing export, repairs public excerpt fields from already-public passages, validates the current safe public policy and text-boundary safety, verifies JSONL counts are preserved, rebuilds generated pages/static assets, and skips Meilisearch reindex unless passages or index settings changed.

## One-command deploy

Use this for normal VPS deploys:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\deploy-public-vps.ps1 -ReleaseName <release-name>
```

The script packages the release, uploads the zip, unpacks to a new release folder, switches the `current` symlink, reloads nginx after `nginx -t`, reindexes Meilisearch, and verifies the deployed path.

For data-changing TikTok/source refreshes, prefer the canonical release gate instead of calling deploy directly:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\base2026-release-gate.ps1 `
  -ReleaseName <release-name> `
  -BatchSet <batch-set> `
  -RunAfterPolish `
  -LatestReadiness 3 `
  -Deploy
```

This runner prevents the common out-of-order failure: public text is exported before a reviewed topic/insight layer exists for the newest source. It also keeps the current-batch polish gate, publication boundary, metadata, export policy, package, deploy/reindex, live crawl, and mobile visual QA in one audited sequence.

## Server deploy shape

1. Upload release zip to `/tmp/<release-name>.zip`.
2. Unzip to `/var/www/base2026-knowledge/releases/<release-name>`.
3. Keep the browser pointed at `/knowledge-search`.
4. Ensure nginx proxies `/knowledge-search/multi-search` to Meilisearch and injects the public search-key Authorization header server-side.
5. Ensure nginx serves `/knowledge/static/` with immutable cache headers and gzip for CSS/JS/JSON/SVG assets.
6. Verify `web/static/documents.jsonl` exists.
7. Verify `web/methodology.html`, `web/opt-out.html`, `web/roadmap.html`, `web/privacy.html`, `web/source-policy.html`, and `web/support.html` exist.
8. Switch `/var/www/base2026-knowledge/current` symlink with `ln -sfnT` so the symlink target is replaced, not nested.
9. Run `nginx -t`.
10. Reload nginx.
11. Verify `/knowledge/`, `/knowledge/roadmap.html`, `/knowledge/privacy.html`, `/knowledge/source-policy.html`, `/knowledge/support.html`, `/knowledge/methodology.html`, `/knowledge/opt-out.html`, `/knowledge/static/documents.jsonl`, and `/knowledge-search/multi-search`.
12. Verify live compression/cache headers:

```bash
curl -I -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, br' https://aggressorbulkit.online/knowledge/static/styles.css
curl -I -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, br' https://aggressorbulkit.online/knowledge/static/meili.js
```

Both static asset checks should show `Content-Encoding: gzip`, `Vary: Accept-Encoding`, and a long-lived `Cache-Control`.

13. Reindex Meilisearch from the deployed release data when `passages.jsonl`, index settings, or topic fields changed.

Current server reindex command shape:

```bash
cd /var/www/base2026-knowledge/current
python3 scripts/meili-index-public.py \
  --data public-data/tiktok/chunks.jsonl \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:7700 \
  --index base2026_public_tiktok \
  --master-key "$(cat /var/www/base2026-knowledge/shared/.meili_master_key)"
```

## Rollback

Switch `current` symlink back to previous release, run `nginx -t`, reload nginx, verify `/knowledge/`.

## Forbidden

- do not overwrite WordPress root
- do not print or commit Meilisearch keys
- do not deploy private local source folders
